## R Example

Let's begin by loading the data that Sal (from Khan Academy) uses in this video. Open a new script file in RStudio, and add the following code:

```{r}
x <- c(15.6, 16.2, 22.5, 20.5, 16.4, 19.4, 16.6, 17.9, 12.7, 13.9)
```

The function `c()` collects the data into a *vector*. We then *assign* (using the assignment operator `<-`) the vector to a new variable that we are calling `x`. 

Now we can calculate the mean and standard deviation of the data. Add the following lines to your script:

```{r}
mean(x)
sd(x)
```

Click the "Source" button to evaluate the script. 

Now let's perform the hypothesis test:

$$H_0: \mu = 20$$
$$H_1: \mu < 20$$

First we need to compute the test statistic:

```{r}
xbar <- mean(x)
sdx <- sd(x)
n <- length(x)
mu0 <- 20

t <- (xbar - mu0)/(sdx/sqrt(n))
```

Now we can enter `t` into the console to view the calculated test statistic.

To perform the t-test, we need to compare the calculated t-statistic to the critical t. For this we can use a t-table, or we can use R to calculate the critical t for us:

```{r}
tcrit <- -qt(0.99, n-1)
```

The `qt()` function finds the critical t values. The first argument (0.99) is the confidence level (1 - 0.01), and `n-1` is the degrees of freedom ($10-1=9$, in this case). Entering `tcrit` into the console shows a value of -2.821438, as expected.

Our t-statistic (-3.00165) is smaller than our critical value, so we *reject* the null hypothesis at the 1% level.

## Practice Question
Perform the same hypothesis test as above using just the first 9 observations from $x$.

<div id="spoiler" style="display:none">

```{r, eval=T}
## Select the first 9 observations from x, store
## as a variable called y
y <- x[1:9]

ybar <- mean(y)
sdy <- sd(y)
n <- length(y)
mu0 <- 20

t <- (ybar - mu0)/(sdy/sqrt(n))

tcrit <- -qt(0.99, n-1)

c(t, tcrit)
```

The t-statistic (-2.54) is not less than the critical value (-2.90). We therefore *fail to reject* the null hypothesis at the 1% level.
