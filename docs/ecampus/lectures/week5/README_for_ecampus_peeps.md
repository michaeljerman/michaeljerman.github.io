# README

Included in this directory are rough drafts of the files I would like to be made available to students for one of the course modules. Ideally, I'd like a single link from Canvas to the table of contents file (toc.html) which would act as the landing page for the week's material. I've added hyperlinks to the bottom of each page so that the students can click through without having to close the tab and go back to Canvas. 

Each page has a practice question at the bottom. I put the answers in a simple "spoiler" environment to give an idea of what I'm looking for there. Whatever you think is best.

I'd also like to have the lecture videos embedded in the pages themselves (I couldn't figure out the embed code on my own, so I provided a link to the videos).

I have to attachment to the format, font, or other css considerations, with the exception of the preformatted code and syntax highlighting. Everything else can be adjusted as you see fit.

Don't hesitate to email me with questions at michael.jerman@oregonstate.edu
