## Residuals and Fitted Values

When we run a regression in R using the `lm()` function, R creates a new *object* that contains the regression results. 

$$wage = \beta_0 + \beta_1 educ + u$$



```{r}
lm(wage ~ educ, data=wage2)
```

The `lm()` function estimates a *linear model*, which is just another way of saying "ordinary least squares." The first argument in the `lm()` function is what R calls a *formula*. Formulas in R are constructed by typing the left-hand-side, dependent variable first, followed by a tilde (`~`), then the right-hand-side, independent variable(s). It looks similar to our model that we wrote above, but we have omitted the coefficients and the error term. We have to use the `~` symbol instead of an equals sign because `=` means something specific in R (note that we use `=` when telling `lm()` to use the `wage2` dataset).

The output of the `lm()` command should look like:

```{r eval=T, echo=F}
lm(wage ~ educ, data=wage2)
```

R is telling us the estimated OLS coefficients. The number reported under `(Intercept)` is the estimate for $\beta_o$, while the number under `educ` is the estimate of $\beta_1$, the coefficient on the `educ` variable. Note that these values are identical to what we found on the previous page. 

## Practice Question
Use the `lm()` function to calculate $\widehat{\beta}_1$ and $\widehat{\beta}_0$ for the model:

$$\ln(wage) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 educ + u$$
