## Lecture Video

**Embedded Video**[https://courses.ecampus.oregonstate.edu/index.php?video=econ424h/wk2.1.mp4](https://courses.ecampus.oregonstate.edu/index.php?video=econ424h/wk2.1.mp4)

## Exploring the Data

In the above video, Professor Pugatch describes why we might care about the relationship between two variables, such as education and earnings. Let's look at a real-world example of this relationship in R.

We'll use data that is provided by the `wooldridge` package in R. If you haven't yet, install this package by typing 

```{r}
install.packages("wooldridge")
```

in the RStudio console (you only need to do this once on your computer). Next, open a new R script and save it as something memorable (I call mine `week1.R`).
