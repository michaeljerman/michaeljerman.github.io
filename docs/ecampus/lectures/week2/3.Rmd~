## R Example

Continuing with the `wage2` dataset, let's calculate the OLS estimates for the model:

$$wage = \beta_0 + \beta_1 educ + u$$

From the above video, we know that:

$$\widehat{\beta}_1 = \dfrac{\widehat{cov}(educ, wage)}{\widehat{var}(educ)}$$

R has built-in commands that allow us to quickly calculate variances and covariances:

```{r}
cov(wage2$educ, wage2$wage)/var(wage2$educ)
```

Note that we *cannot* simply type `cov(educ, wage)` and `var(educ)` (try it!). This is because R doesn't know what the variables `educ` and `wage` refer to---neither are defined in the environment (the top-right panel in RStudio). Instead, we have to tell R to look within the `wage2` object to find those variables. We do that by using the dollar-sign symbol `$`. We start with the object `wage2`, then use the dollar sign followed by the variable of interest. This tells R to use that specific column (vector) from our data frame. The code `wage2$educ` tells R "choose only the education data from the `wage2` dataset."

In the console, we see that the OLS estimate of $\beta_1$ is 60.21428. We can use this along with the sample means of `wage` and `educ` to calculate the intercept:

$$\widehat{\beta}_0 = \overline{wage} - \widehat{\beta}_1 \overline{educ}$$

We can calculate the mean of our two variables with the `mean()` function:

```{r}
mean(wage2$educ)
mean(wage2$wage)
```

Now we can copy and paste the reported numbers and calculate $\widehat{\beta}_0$. 

There's an easier way, however. Instead of copy/paste, we can let R do the hard work for us by saving the output of each command as a variable in R:

```{r}
beta1_hat <- cov(wage2$educ, wage2$wage)/var(wage2$educ)
wage_bar <- mean(wage2$wage)
educ_bar <- mean(wage2$educ)

wage_bar - beta1_hat*educ_bar
```

According to R, the estimated vertical intercept is $\widehat{\beta}_0 = 146.9524$. 

## Practice Question
Calculate $\widehat{\beta}_1$ and $\widehat{\beta}_0$ for the model:

$$\ln(wage) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 educ + u$$

<div id="spoiler" style="display:none">


```{r, eval=T}
beta1_hat <- cov(wage2$educ, wage2$lwage)/var(wage2$educ)
beta1_hat
lwage_bar <- mean(wage2$lwage)
educ_bar <- mean(wage2$educ)
lwage_bar - beta1_hat*educ_bar
```

</div>
