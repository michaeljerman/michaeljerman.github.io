<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>India’s general election of 1996 signaled a new era of political instability and competition, with three
subsequent elections and five separate governments formed within three years. The political turmoil
during this time created large incentives for vote-buying and other forms of clientelism. I find that
electorally competitive cities in the Ganges basin during this period were more likely to receive funding
for pollution abatement from the federal government of India. These same cities were less likely to receive
increased water pollution monitoring after the 1996 election. These findings are robust to a variety of
specifications and controls. Placeo tests indicate that these results are unlikely to be driven by unobserved
differences among cities. The empirical findings are explained by forward-looking policymakers engaging
in clientelism. The welfare effects are ambiguous given the lack of information on environmental quality. I
emphasize the need for dramatically increased water pollution monitoring along India’s rivers and streams.</p>
