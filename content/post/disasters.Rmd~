## Abstract

I propose a universal method for disaggregating count statistics. The method is able to disaggregate regional statistics such as those collected by censuses or surveys. The output of the procedure is a dasymetric map of pixel-level estimates that preserves the aggregate counts over the data collection region. I demonstrate the algorithm by disaggregating Ugandan census counts of population, tabooda (kerosene lamp) usage, people consuming two or more meals per day, and subsistence farms counted at the subcounty level (the smallest administrative unit reported by the census). Out-of-sample validation suggests that the procedure performs similarly for each statistic and that out-of-sample errors are approximately mean zero throughout the distribution. When combined with nighttime light luminosity data, the disaggregated data can describe within-subcounty distributions of income and poverty. I find that this previously-unobserved within-subcounty inequality accounts for 39.3\% of aggregate observed inequality. Next I show that the disaggregated census data can be combined with satellite-derived air pollution data to estimate pixel level estimates of pollution exposure. I find that 22\% of aggregate inequality in air pollution exposure is caused by within-subcounty inequality in exposure. Additionally, pixel-level pollution exposure has an ``inverted-U'' relationship with per capita luminosity in the cross section, consistent with the classical formulation of the environmental Kuznets curve.
