## Abstract

I use nighttime light luminosity data to estimate the effect of race on the recovery
economic activity following a natural disaster. Within counties where a major disaster is declared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, census tracts with
higher proportions of Hispanic and black residents grow significantly more slowly in
the immediate aftermath of the natural disaster. The result is robust to the inclusion
of a variety of tract-level demographic and economic controls. Using a method similar
to a “triple differences” approach, I find that census tracts with a high proportion of
minority residents in counties declared disaster areas do not recover more quickly than
similar tracts that are not eligible for disaster aid, while tracts with a high proportion of white residents are substantially better off. These results are consistent with a
model of disaster recovery where the racial bias policymakers partially determines the
allocation of scarce government resources.
