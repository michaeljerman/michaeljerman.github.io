	  <h2> ECON 499: The Economics of Inequality </h2>

	  <h2> Winter 2018  </h2>

	</section>

		<section data-markdown>
	  ### Readings (on Canvas):

	  - Atkinson section 3.4

	  - [Sen (1979)](http://www.ophi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Sen-1979_Equality-of-What.pdf) *(recommended)*
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Normative theory

	  - We have seen various ways to measure inequality and different properties of measures

	  - Indices can disagree with one another!

	  - Can we project our personal (or societal) values onto different distributions?

	  - When can we say that one distribution is *better* or *worse* than another?
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Positive vs normative

	  - Much of economics can be broken down into *normative* vs *positive* analysis

	  - Positive claims can be verified, normative claims reflect values

	  - Positive claim: The Gini index for the US in 2016 was 45.0

	  - Normative claim: The Gini index for the US should be lower
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Normative theory

	  - Start with a set of values, then see what the implications of those values are

	  - Alternatively: Start with result, then see what kind of values we would need to have to make that result hold

	  - What sort of preferences might *rationalize* certain statements about inequality?
	</section>


	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Economic agents

	  - We assume people derive utility from their consumption of goods and services
	  - The more goods and services people are able to choose from, the better off they are
	  - Additional income increases the choice set, more goods and services available to consume
	  - Income creates *indirect* utility
	  - $u(x_i)$ is the indirect utility derived from an income of $x_i$

	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Utility and social well-being

	  - Idea: Since utility measures well-being, can we use it to compare income distributions?
	  - Can the utility of individuals within the income distribution help inform which distributions are preferable?
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Diminishing marginal utility of income

	  - Our enjoyment of additional income gets lower as our income gets higher
	  - I'd be extremely happy if someone gave me \$100 --- Mark Zuckerberg probably wouldn't care very much
	  - We should weigh lower incomes more heavily than higher incomes
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Utilitarianism

	  - The optimal distribution of income may be achieved by maximizing aggregate utility
	  - Same as equating marginal utility for each person
	  - Each additional unit of income will go to the person who will "enjoy" it the most
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Problems

	  - Utility functions are not unique (ECON 311). Which do we choose?
	  - People can have vastly different marginal utilities of income
	  - [Sen:](http://www.ophi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Sen-1979_Equality-of-What.pdf) Consider a person who experiences a physical disability. They will derive less utility from a given level of income, since they have fewer opportunities to spend that money
	  - Compare that person to a "pleasure-wizard" who derives large satisfaction from small increases in income
	  
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Social welfare

	  - Utility only measures well being from your own income
	  - People care about the income of other people
	  - We can capture this with a *social welfare function*
	  - A SWF is like a utility function for society as a whole
	  - Rather than think of the utility derived from one income, we think of the total utility that is gained from everyone at all points in the distribution

	  ||
	  |:-:|
	  |$W(x) = W(x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_N)$|

	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Rawlsian SWF interpretation 

	  - John Rawls (1971): Think about distributions from behind a "veil of ignorance"
	  - Before you are born, you get to choose which society you live in
	  - You have an equal chance of being born anywhere within that society
	  - Societies with high inequality mean that there is a higher risk of being poor
	  - The SWF is therefore just a measure of *risk-aversion* --- how much of a gamble are you willing to take?
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Von-Neumann-Morgenstern Utility

	  - People have preferences over outcomes that occur probabilistically
	  - With certain assumptions on preferences (similar to 311 rationality assumptions), we can order preferences over risk

 	  ||
	  |:-:|
	  |$U(x, p) = p_1u(x_1) + p_2u(x_2) + ... + p_Nu(x_N)$|
	  
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Risk aversion

	  - Agents are *risk averse* if they are willing to take an expected loss to avoid uncertainty
	  - This occurs whenever agents have diminishing marginal utility of income
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### CRRA Utility

	  - If an agent's risk aversion is constant for any level of income, then we say that they have *constant relative risk aversion*
	  - Utility can be represented as
	  
	  ||
	  |:-:|
	  |$u(y) = \frac{y^1-\epsilon}{1-\epsilon}$|
	  
	  - $\epsilon$ is the amount of risk aversion
	  - This is the *same* $\epsilon$ from the Atkinson measure!
	</section>
	
	
	<section>
	  <h3> Atkinson measure, revisited </h3>

	  $$ I_A(x, \epsilon) = 1 - \left(\dfrac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N\left(\dfrac{x_i}{\mu}\right)^{1-\epsilon}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\epsilon}} $$

	  <p> &nbsp; </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li> A person with CRRA utility (given $\epsilon$) will always prefer a distribution with a lower Atkinson index! </li>
	  </ul>

	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Inequality aversion

	  Another way to interpret $\epsilon$:
	  - Imagine we are going to transfer \$100 from a rich person to a poor person
	  - We put the money (coins) in a bucket to bring to the poor person
	  - The bucket has a hole, and the money slowly falls out in transit
	  - How much money are we prepared to lose before we decide not to go through with the transfer?
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Leaky bucket interpretation

	  #### Distribution A 
	  || Obie | Michael | Llewelyn | Rudy | Kitty |
	  |---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
	  |$x:$|2|5|9|20|30|
	  ||

	  #### Take 10 from Kitty to give to Obie, but we lose $\delta\times 10$ along the way:
	  ---
	  #### Distribution B 
	  || Obie | Michael | Llewelyn | Rudy | Kitty |
	  |---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
	  |$x':$|**$2+(10-\delta\times 10)$**|5|9|20|**$30-10$**|

	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Leaky bucket interpretation

	  - $\delta = 0$: Obie gets all of the transfer
	  - $\delta = 1$: Obie gets none of the transfer
	  - What is the highest value of $\delta$ that we are willing to have?
	  - $\delta$ is our measure of *inequality aversion*

	  - $\epsilon = \frac{1}{2\delta}$

	  ### Social choice theory

	  - Level of risk aversion matters for how we rank distributions
	  - How can we agree on which aversion parameter to use as a society?
	  - Do we even agree that we have CRRA?
	  - Arrow's Impossibility Theorem: Under certain (general) conditions, it's impossible to find a "best" social welfare function!
	  - Can we say anything about more general utility specifications?
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Lorenz domination
	  
	  - A distribution $x$ is said to *Lorenz dominate* distribution $x'$ if the Lorenz curve for $x$ is above $x'$
	</section>

	<section>
	  <h4> Example: </h4>
	  $$x=(5,7,10,19,25)$$

	  $$x' = (2,5,9,20,30)$$
	  
	  <img src="img/lorenz2.png" width=65%>

	  $$x~ \text{Lorenz dominates} ~ x'$$
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Atkinson theorem

	  Suppose $x$ and $x'$ are two distributions with the same mean. Any risk-averse person (diminishing marginal utility of income) will *always* prefer a society with distribution $x$ if $x$ Lorenz dominates $x'$.

	  - A SWF that weighs the incomes of poorer people more heavily than richer people will be greater under $x$
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Example

	  #### Distribution A
	  || Obie | Michael | Llewelyn | Rudy | Kitty |
	  |---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
	  |$x:$|2|5|9|20|30|
	  |Cumulative income:|2|7|16|36|66|
	  |Cumulative share:|0.03|0.11|0.24|0.54|1|
	  |$~$|

	  ---
	  #### Distribution B
	  || Obie | Michael | Llewelyn | Rudy | Kitty |
	  |---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
	  |$x':$|20|50|90|200|300|
	  |Cumulative income:|20|70|160|360|660|
	  |Cumulative share:|0.03|0.11|0.24|0.54|1|
	  |$~$|

	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Generalized Lorenz curves

	  - The Atkinson theorem doesn't hold if the mean is not the same

	  - What happens if average income doubles, but inequality is slightly worse?

	  - We can instead use *generalized Lorenz curves*, which are formed by multiplying the cumulative share by the mean
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Generalized Lorenz example

	  #### Distribution A (mean = 13.2)
	  || Obie | Michael | Llewelyn | Rudy | Kitty |
	  |---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
	  |$x:$|2|5|9|20|30|
	  |Cumulative income:|2|7|16|36|66|
	  |Cumulative share:|0.03|0.11|0.24|0.54|1|
	  |Cum. share $\times$ mean:|0.4|1.4|3.2|7.2|13.2|

	  ---
	  #### Distribution B (mean = 132)
	  || Obie | Michael | Llewelyn | Rudy | Kitty |
	  |---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
	  |$x':$|20|50|90|200|300|
	  |Cumulative income:|20|70|160|360|660|
	  |Cumulative share:|0.03|0.11|0.24|0.54|1|
	  |Cum. share $\times$ mean:|4|14|32|72|132|

	</section>

	<section>
	  <h4> Generalized Lorenz curves </h4>
	  $$x=(2,5,9,20,30)$$

	  $$x' = (20,50,90,200,300)$$
	  
	  <img src="img/generalizedLorenz.png" width=65%>

	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Shorrocks Theorem

	  Suppose $x$ and $x'$ are two distributions. Any risk averse person (diminishing marginal utility of income) will always prefer a society with distribution $x$ if the generalized Lorenz curve for $x$ dominates that of $x'$


	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Generalized Lorenz curves in the real world

	  - We can't compare distributions with the Shorrocks theorem if generalized Lorenz curves intersect
	  - Generalized Lorenz domination is not something we observe with great frequency in the real world
	  - In practice we must make more strict normative assumptions (i.e. level of risk aversion)
