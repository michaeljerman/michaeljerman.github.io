	  ### Mobility and the "American Dream"

	  - "The land of opportunity" --- hard work is what is necessary to become well-off

	  - The status of your parents shouldn't matter

	  - American economy should reward good ideas and skills, not nepotism

	  - Does inequality impact these ideals?
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Intergenerational mobility

	  - The extent to which generations vary among income groups is called "intergenerational mobility"

	  - How likely is it that a child of low-income parents will become high income? (upward mobility)

	  - What factors influence mobility?
	</section>

	  ### Great Gatsby curve

	  - *The Great Gatsby*: Famous American novel about wealth and class differences

	  - Gatsby curve: The relationship between inequality and mobility

	  - To what extent is advantage/disadvantage passed on to children?

	  - "Intergenerational earnings elasticity:" The correlation between parental earnings and child earnings

	  ### US vs Canada

	  - The US intergenerational elasticity is twice that of Canada

	  - On average, Americans are much more likely to have similar income as their parents

	  - This is mostly driven by high and low income, middle income mobility is the same as Canada

	  ### Polarization and mobility

	  - Jobs that require "some" skills are becoming more scarce

	  - Most jobs require a lot of skills, or few skills

	  - It is more costly to cross the "skill divide"

	  ### Education and mobility

	  - Highly educated parents are rewarded for their education

	  - They are able to spend more on their children's education

	  - Lower income families may not be able to invest enough to get over the skill gap

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Other factors

	  - Parental connections

	  - Peers and environment

	  - Expectations/disenfranchisement 
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Inequality and segregation

	  - Diverging top incomes might allow wealthy to move away from lower income neighbors

	  - Sorting into communities based on income

	  - Access to services, education, labor market connections, differ across communities

	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Parental connections

	  - Parents are able to use their labor market connections to get jobs for their children

	  - The strength/status of labor market connections will influence mobility for children

	  - A high-income parent can use their connections at their firms to get their children high-income jobs

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Peers and environment

	  - Peers may have an influence on labor market "trajectories"

	  - Aspirations/expectations can be formed by peers and environment

	  - Quality of teachers and community resources can affect educational attainment
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Determining causality

	  - There is a strong correlation between childhood community and education/wages

	  - Does not imply causation

	  - People may sort themselves into communities based on characteristics

	  - These characteristics may be passed down to children
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Moving to opportunity program

	  - Program administered by Department of Housing and Urban Development

	  - Families in high-poverty public housing were randomly selected to receive a voucher to move to lower poverty neighborhoods

	  - Since vouchers were assigned randomly, differences observed after the move can be causally attributed to neighborhood effects

	  - Effects should be stronger for children who move younger

	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Parental influence

	  - It could be that parents earn more in high-income neighborhoods, use increase in earnings to pay for more child education

	  - Data suggest that parental earnings do not change as a result of the voucher

	  - The effect is mostly through children's direct exposure to lower-poverty neighborhoods

	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Program participation

	  - Parents in the Moving to Opportunity program decide whether or not to use voucher

	  - Parents who use voucher might be different from parents who don't use voucher

	  - Voucher use might be correlated with child performance

	  - What happens when people are *forced* to move?

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Mobility shocks

	  - People under 25 who were forced to move saw their incomes increase as a result

	  - No effect/negative effect for older cohorts

	  - Younger cohorts also received 3.6 more years of schooling than their peers

	  - Children of people who were forced to move received 4.7 additional years of schooling
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Expectations

	  - People's expectations of future success may be a function of environment

	  - Low-income students in high-inequality communities might feel "economic despair"

	  - If students feel opportunities are out of reach, they might underinvest in education

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Summary

	  - Inequality can be passed down through generations

	  - Parents and children in low income groups underinvest in education

	  - This is due to lower returns on education, peer/environment effects, expectations

	  - Inequality is not self-correcting --- otherwise able workers are not contributing to their full potential
