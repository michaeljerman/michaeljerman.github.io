<li>Studied 1992 increase in minimum wage in New Jersey</li>
<li>Conducted an employment survey of fast-food restaurants 2 months before the minimum wage change and 7 months after</li>
<li>Also surveyed restaurants in eastern Pennsylvania to serve as the control group</li>
<li>This is known as a "difference-in-differences" approach&#x2013;both groups might change, so we look at the <b>relative</b> change between the two groups (New Jersey and Pennsylvania)</li>

<ul>
<li>Measuring minimum wage
<ul>
<li>Firms may respond to minimum wages by changing the types of workers they hire, substitute to higher-skill workers</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Adjustment time
<ul>
<li>Firms may take months or years to adjust to minimum wage, changing technology, training other workers, etc</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Parallel trends
<ul>
<li>Wage and employment growth in Pennsylvania was different from New Jersey before the minimum wage, perhaps not a good control</li>

<h2 id="orgc51d4ff">Subsequent research</h2>
<ul>
<li>No consensus!</li>
<li>Wide range of estimates depend on how employment is measured, types of industry, types of workers, etc</li>
<li>Neumark and Wascher (2006) review 108 studies, find increased unemployment in nearly 2/3 (85% of most "credible" studies)</li>
<li>Effects seem to be concentrated among least skilled workers</li>

<blockquote nil>
<p>
I am confident that a federal minimum wage that rises to around $12 an hour over the next five years or so would not have a meaningful negative effect on United States employment.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote nil>
<p>
But $15 an hour is beyond international experience, and could well be counterproductive. Although some high-wage cities and states could probably absorb a $15-an-hour minimum wage with little or no job loss, it is far from clear that the same could be said for every state, city and town in the United States.

<ul>
<li>In addition to paying taxes, people receive credits, deductions, transfers, and benefits</li>
<li>As income increases, these benefits tend to decrease</li>
<li>This effectively makes taxes less progressive</li>
<li>In extreme cases, marginal tax rates can be greater than 100% (making 1 more dollar means you have less total income)</li>

<li>It should be effective in reducing inequality</li>
<li>People who receive redistribution should be deserving of it</li>

<p>
American Enterprise Institute (2017) proposes 8 market-based approaches to reducing inequality:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Reducing rent-seeking in the form of professional protections
<ul>
<li>Example: Doctors in America earn twice as much as doctors in other wealthy countries, but health outcomes are no better</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Facilitate health travel
<ul>
<li>Much of the income gains for low-income workers is in the form of health expenditures</li>
<li>Rapidly rising costs means that they aren't getting much more health services in exchange</li>
<li>Making it easier for people to travel for healthcare might reduce health expenditures, allow income to be spent elsewhere</li>

</ul></li>

</ol>

<section id="slide-org4a61c0b">
<h2 id="org4a61c0b">Market-based solutions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Allow medicare expenses to be paid overseas
<ul>
<li>Save money for Federal government</li>
<li>Force US providers to compete with foreign providers in Medicare markets</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Reform patent system for prescription drugs
<ul>
<li>Generic drugs are usually 80-90% cheaper than name-brand, large savings are possible</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Replace corporate income tax with government shares
<ul>
<li>Corporate income tax is highly distortionary and easy to avoid</li>
<li>Instead, grant the government a fixed proportion of non-voting shares</li>
<li>Eliminates distortion, which (hopefully) increases employment</li>
