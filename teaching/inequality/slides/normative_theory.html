	  # Normative Theory

	  ## ECON 499: Economics of Inequality

	  ## Winter 2018
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Readings (on Canvas):

	  - Atkinson section 3.4

	  - Sen (1979) *(recommended)*
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Normative theory

	  - We have seen various ways to measure inequality and different properties of measures

	  - Indices can disagree with one another!

	  - Can we project our personal (or societal) values onto different distributions?

	  - When can we say that one distribution is *better* or *worse* than another?
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Positive vs normative

	  - Much of economics can be broken down into *normative* vs *positive* analysis

	  - Positive claims can be verified, normative claims reflect values

	  - Positive claim: The Gini index for the US in 2016 was 45.0

	  - Normative claim: The Gini index for the US should be lower
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Normative theory

	  - Start with a set of values, then see what the implications of those values are

	  - Alternatively: Start with result, then see what kind of values we would need to have to make that result hold
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### A (very) brief overview of utility thoery

	  - Economists tend to think about value in terms of *utility*

	  - Utility is (roughly) our well-being, satisfaction, or happiness
	  
	  - Long history in philosophy, but very specific meaning in economics
	  
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Economic agents

	  - We assume people derive satisfaction from their ability to consume goods and services

	  - The more goods and services people are able to choose from, the better off they are

	  - Utility is the satisfaction that people get from the ability to choose

	  - Express utility as a number that allows us to rank different alternatives (higher utility means more satisfaction)
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Utility and income

	  - All else equal, more income allows us to buy more things

	  - Our utility increases as income increases

	  - **Diminishing marginal utility**: Our enjoyment of additional income gets lower as our income gets higher

	  - I'd be extremely happy if someone gave me \$100 --- Mark Zuckerberg probably wouldn't care very much
	</section>
	
	<section>
	  <h4>Utility </h4>
	  
	  <img src="img/utility.png" width=60%/>

	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Social welfare

	  - Utility only measures well being from your own income

	  - People care about the income of other people

	  - We can capture this with a *social welfare function*

	  - A SWF is like a utility function for society as a whole

	  - Rather than think of the utility derived from one income, we think of the total utility that is gained from everyone at all points in the distribution

	  ||
	  |:-:|
	  |$W(x) = u(x_1) + u(x_2) + ... + u(x_N)$|

	  - This allows us to weight the utilities of every person --- perhaps we care about the improving the well being of a very poor person more than Bill Gates, for instance
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Problem:

	  - People have different utility functions. How do we decide which utility function to use?

	  - Sen (1971): Consider a person who experiences a physical disability. They will derive less utility from a given level of income, since they have fewer opportunities to spend that money

	  - Compare that person to a "pleasure-wizard" who derives large satisfaction from small increases in income

	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Rawlsian SWF interpretation 

	  - John Rawls (1971): Think about distributions from behind a "veil of ignorance"

	  - Before you are born, you get to choose which society you live in

	  - You have an equal chance of being born anywhere within that society

	  - Societies with high inequality mean that there is a higher risk of being poor

	  - The SWF is therefore just a measure of *risk-aversion* --- how much of a gamble are you willing to take?
	</section>

	  ### Example:

	  $$ x = (5,7,10,19,25) $$

	  $$ x' = (2,5,9,20,30)  $$

	  ### Lorenz domination

	  - A distribution $x$ is said to *Lorenz dominate* distribution $x'$ if the Lorenz curve for $x$ is above $x'$
	</section>

	<section>
	  <h4> Example: </h4>
	  $$x=(5,7,10,19,25)$$

	  $$x' = (2,5,9,20,30)$$
	  
	  <img src="img/lorenz2.png" width=65%>

	  $$x~ \text{Lorenz dominates} ~ x'$$
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Atkinson theorem

	  Suppose $x$ and $x'$ are two distributions with the same mean. A person with diminishing marginal utility of income will always prefer a society with distribution $x$ if $x$ Lorenz dominates $x'$.

	  - A SWF that weights the incomes of poorer people more heavily than richer people will be greater under $x$
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Example

	  #### Distribution A
	  || Obie | Michael | Llewelyn | Rudy | Kitty |
	  |---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
	  |$x:$|2|5|9|20|30|
	  |Cumulative income:|2|7|16|36|66|
	  |Cumulative share:|0.03|0.11|0.24|0.54|1|
	  |$~$|

	  ---
	  #### Distribution B
	  || Obie | Michael | Llewelyn | Rudy | Kitty |
	  |---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
	  |$x':$|20|50|90|200|300|
	  |Cumulative income:|20|70|160|360|660|
	  |Cumulative share:|0.03|0.11|0.24|0.54|1|
	  |$~$|

	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Generalized Lorenz curves

	  - The Atkinson theorem doesn't hold if the mean is not the same

	  - What happens if average income doubles, but inequality is slightly worse?

	  - We can instead use *generalized Lorenz curves*, which are formed by multiplying the cumulative share by the mean
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Generalized Lorenz example

	  #### Distribution A (mean = 13.2)
	  || Obie | Michael | Llewelyn | Rudy | Kitty |
	  |---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
	  |$x:$|2|5|9|20|30|
	  |Cumulative income:|2|7|16|36|66|
	  |Cumulative share:|0.03|0.11|0.24|0.54|1|
	  |Cum. share $\times$ mean:|0.4|1.4|3.2|7.2|13.2|

	  ---
	  #### Distribution B (mean = 132)
	  || Obie | Michael | Llewelyn | Rudy | Kitty |
	  |---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
	  |$x':$|20|50|90|200|300|
	  |Cumulative income:|20|70|160|360|660|
	  |Cumulative share:|0.03|0.11|0.24|0.54|1|
	  |Cum. share $\times$ mean:|4|14|32|72|132|

	</section>

	<section>
	  <h4> Generalized Lorenz curves </h4>
	  $$x=(2,5,9,20,30)$$

	  $$x' = (20,50,90,200,300)$$
	  
	  <img src="img/generalizedLorenz.png" width=65%>

	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Shorrocks Theorem

	  Suppose $x$ and $x'$ are two distributions. A person with diminishing marginal utility of income will always prefer a society with distribution $x$ if the generalized Lorenz curve for $x$ dominates that of $x'$

	  - The same kind of SWF as in the Atkinson theorem

	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Inequality aversion

	  - Diminishing marginal utility of income means that people are "inequality averse"

	  - Now assume that the degree to which people are averse to inequality is constant

	  - Changes in mean income do not affect your attitudes toward inequality
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Inequality aversion

	  The leaky bucket:

	  - Imagine we are going to transfer \$100 from a rich person to a poor person

	  - We put the money (coins) in a bucket to bring to the poor person

	  - The bucket has a hole, and the money slowly falls out in transit

	  - How much money are we prepared to lose before we decide not to go through with the transfer?
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Leaky bucket

	  	  #### Distribution A 
	  || Obie | Michael | Llewelyn | Rudy | Kitty |
	  |---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
	  |$x:$|2|5|9|20|30|
	  ||

	  #### Take 10 from Kitty to give to Obie, but we lose $\delta\times 10$ along the way:
	  ---
	  #### Distribution B 
	  || Obie | Michael | Llewelyn | Rudy | Kitty |
	  |---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
	  |$x':$|**$2+(10-\delta\times 10)$**|5|9|20|**$30-10$**|

	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Leaky bucket

	  - $\delta = 0$: Obie gets all of the transfer

	  - $\delta = 1$: Obie gets none of the transfer

	  - What is the highest value of $\delta$ that we are willing to have?

	  - $\delta$ is our measure of *inequality aversion* for our SWF

	  <h3> Atkinson measure, revisited </h3>

	  $$ I_A(x, \epsilon) = 1 - \left(\dfrac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N\left(\dfrac{x_i}{\mu}\right)^{1-\epsilon}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\epsilon}} $$

	  <p> &nbsp; </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li> $\epsilon = \dfrac{1}{2\delta}$ </li>
	    <li> The Atkinson measure ranks distributions in accordance with a constant inequality aversion SWF </li>
	    <li> $\epsilon$ measures how much of a trade-off we are willing to accept between total (or average) income and inequality
	  </ul>
