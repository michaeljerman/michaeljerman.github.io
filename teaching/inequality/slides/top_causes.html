	  # The Top 1%

	  ## EC 399: Economics of Inequality

	  ## Spring 2017
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Four questions:

	  1. What is inequality?

	  2. What causes inequality?

	  3. What are the consequences of inequality?

	  4. What can we do about inequality?
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Readings

	  1. Kaplan and Rauh (2013)

	  2. Bonica et al (2013) (optional)
	</section>

	<section>
	  <img src="img/piketty_fig2.png" width=90%>	  
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### What's causing top incomes to diverge?

	  - Piketty and Saez speculate that tax rates and "social attitudes" are responsible

	  - Do not provide conclusive evidence

	  - Other explanations: Political "capture," exploitation, fraud, etc

	  - Matters for policy (LeBron James parable)
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Kaplan and Rauh (2013)

	  - "It's the Market: The Broad-Based Rise in the Return to Top Talent"

	  - Does the top 1% "earn" their income, or do the get it though other means?

	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Economic rents

	  - Things that are used in production of goods and services are called *factors of production* (labor, machines, factories, etc)

	  - Factors are compensated because they are productive (wages, interest, etc)
	  
	  - A payment received by a factor beyond what can be explained by their productivity is a *rent*

	  - Examples: Occupational licensing, monopolies, patents

	  - A rent is wealth that is earned through a process that does not itself create wealth

	  - Are top wage earners very productive, or do they receive rents?
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Executive power

	  - Top CEOs power over their companies and boards

	  - They might be able to use this power to pay themselves more than what they are otherwise worth (extract rents)

	  - If so, we expect CEO pay to diverge from other top earners
	</section>

	<section>
	  <img src='img/kaplan_fig2.png' width=90%>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Other industries

	  - If CEOs are leveraging their power to get higher incomes, then their income should be rising faster than other high-payed workers

	  - Authors consider hedge-fund managers, lawyers, and professional athletes

	  - Managerial power is unlikely to explain rises in all these professions
	</section>

	  <img src='img/kaplan_tab1.png' width=90%>
	</section>

	<section>
	  <img src='img/kaplan_fig3.png' width=90%>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Inherited wealth

	  - Do high income earners have an unfair advantage at birth?

	  - Can parents "buy" income for their children?

	  - Do the wealthy create institutions that prevent the non-wealthy from participating?
	</section>

	<section>
	  <img src='img/kaplan_fig5.png' width=90%>
	</section>

	<section>
	  <img src='img/kaplan_fig6.png' width=90%>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  - High income earners today do not have high-income parents

	  - However, they *do* have upper middle class parents

	  - Very few of the wealthiest CEOs are from poor families

	  - High income earners have more education than in the past (much more on this later in the course)
	</section>

	<section>
	  <img src='img/kaplan_tab2.png' width=90%>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Skills

	  - Most of the pay increase is in industries that require specialized skills

	  - Computers and IT require education, finance has become extremely complex

	  - Executives in these fields must be highly trained, oversee many other highly trained employees
	</section>
	

	<section>
	  <img src='img/kaplan_fig8.png' width=90%>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Family wealth

	  - Having (some) family wealth seems to be more important in the US than in other countries

	  - This might be due to education being more expensive, or education more rewarded in US markets
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Bonica et al (2013)

	  - "Why Hasn't Democracy Slowed Rising Inequality?"

	  - Anecdotally, people seem to care as much (or more) about inequality today as in the past

	  - Why haven't voters demanded redistribution?

	  - Article written by prominent political scientists (in an economics journal)
	</section>

	</section>
	
	<section>
	  <img src='img/bonica_fig2.png' width=90%>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Causality?

	  - Inequality could cause polarization to increase --- wealthier people may have different political preferences than non-wealthy

	  - Polarization might cause inequality --- more legislative gridlock, government less responsive to market changes that increase inequality

	  - A third factor might be causing both simultaneously
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  
	### Deregulation

	- Fewer financial regulations encourage highly-educated people to go into finance

	- Educated people are more skilled, get higher wages

	</section>

	<section>
	  <img src='img/bonica_fig3.png' width=90%>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Voting

	  - Wealthier people more likely to vote

	  - May be more likely to vote for policies that favor the wealthy

	</section>

	<section>
	  <img src='img/bonica_fig4.png' width=90%>
	</section>

	<section>
	  <img src='img/bonica_fig5.png' width=75%>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Left vs right?

	  - US political system is largely "winner-takes-all"

	  - If wealthy are affiliated with one party, then redistribution policies might be enacted if other party is in power

	  - If wealthy are in both parties, then neither party will support redistribution
	</section>
	
	<section>
	  <img src='img/bonica_fig7.png' width=75%>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Summary

	  - Top incomes are largely driven by market forces, return to talent

	  - Top earners give more money to politicians than anyone else

	  - Top earners and donations are (for the most part) evenly distributed on the left-right divide

	  - Gridlock means government cannot respond to changes in market that give rise to inequality
