*Nim*
- Today we'll play an alternative version of nim
- One row of 20 lines
- Each turn, the player must choose to remove 1, 2, or 3 lines
- The last person to remove a line wins

* 
*Decisions vs games*
- /Decisions/ are choices that can be made "without concern for reaction or response from others"
- /Strategic games/ (or just /games/) are choices that occur among "mutually aware players"
  - Players in strategic games take into account the cross-effects of their actions and the actions of other players

* 
*Classifying games*
- Games can be:
  - Sequential or simultaneous
  - Zero sum or non-zero sum
  - Single state or repeated
    - Infinite or finite repetition
  - Perfect or imperfect information
  - Fixed or manipulable rules

* 
*Sequential vs simultaneous games*
- Sequential games
  - Players take turns (one after another)
  - Players look ahead at what might happen in the future to make choices
- Simultaneous games
  - Players make choices at the same time
  - Must predict what other players will do contemporaneously 

* 
*Nim*
- Sequential or simultaneous?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
- /sequential/

* 
*Rock, paper, scissors*
- Sequential or simultaneous?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
- /simultaneous/

* 
*Chess*
- Sequential or simultaneous?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
- /sequential/

* 
*A single play in American football*
- Sequential or simultaneous?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
- /simultaneous/

* 
*A soccer penalty kick*
- Sequential or simultaneous?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
- /simultaneous/

* 
*Registering for classes*
- Sequential or simultaneous?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
- ?

* 
*Constant-sum vs non-constant-sum games*
- Constant sum
  - The sum total payoffs are fixed
  - Playing the game only determines the allocation of payoffs, not the total amount
- Zero sum
  - A special case of constant sum where total payoffs are zero
  - Often used to refer to constant-sum games
- Non-constant sum
  - Total payoffs depend on choices of players

* 
*Nim*
- Constant or non-constant sum?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
- /constant (zero)/

* 
*Rock, paper, scissors*
- Constant or non-constant sum?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
- /constant (zero)/

* 
*Splitting the last piece of cake with someone*
- Constant or non-constant sum?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
- /constant (not zero)/

* 
*Chicken (stay straight or swerve)*
- Constant or non-constant sum?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
- /non-constant/

* 
*International trade*
- Constant or non-constant sum?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
- /non-constant/

* 
*Example*
- All-pay auction
  - You will bid to receive a $5 bill
  - You have to pay me your highest bid /regardless if you win or lose the auction/
  - Everyone who bids has to pay, but only one person will win the $5

* 
*Constant-sum games*
- Constant-sum games can be either:
  - Negative sum (war, household chores)
  - Zero sum (sports, games with a "winner" and "loser")
  - Positive sum (eating cake)
- Non-constant-sum games can be any of the above, too
  - Sometimes positive /and/ negative sums are possible in the same game (all-pay auction)

* 
*Single-stage and repeated games*
- Single-stage games are played (against some particular opponents) and never again
- Repeated games are played over and over
  - Can be finitely or infinitely repeated
  - Choices in one round (stage) might affect later rounds (and vice versa)

* 
*Golden Balls (split or steal)*
- Single-stage or repeated?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
- /single-stage/

* 
*"Battle of wits" (poison cups)*
- Single-stage or repeated?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
- /single-stage/

* 
*A baseball plate appearance (pitcher vs batter)*
- Single-stage or repeated?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
- /repeated/

* 
*OPEC oil production*
- Single-stage or repeated?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
- /repeated/

* 
*Perfect and imperfect information*
- Perfect information
  - Players know exactly what choice are available to each player and what the payoffs will be (given choices)
- Imperfect information
  - Uncertainty over choices or payoffs (or both)
  - External uncertainty: "Nature" (the state of the world) changes choices or payoffs
  - Strategic uncertainty: Imperfect information about what other players are doing or have done in the past

* 
*Nim*
- Perfect or imperfect information?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
- /perfect information/

* 
*Chess*
- Perfect or imperfect information?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
- /perfect information/

* 
*Vacation planning*
- Perfect of imperfect information?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
- /imperfect information (external uncertainty)/

* 
*Applying for jobs*
- Perfect of imperfect information?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
- /imperfect information (strategic uncertainty)/

* 
*Poker*
- Perfect of imperfect information?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
- /imperfect information (strategic uncertainty)/

* 
*Fixed and manipulable rules*
- Fixed rules can't be altered by players
- The choices available to each player are constant and known

* 
*Nim*
- Fixed or manipulable rules?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
- /fixed/

* 
*Political campaigns*
- Fixed or manipulable rules?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
- /manipulable/

* 
*Advertising*
- Fixed or manipulable rules?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
- /manipulable/

* 
*Defining a game*
- A strategic game must contain three elements:
  1. Players
  2. Strategies
  3. Payoffs
- We make various assumptions about these elements

* 
*Players*
- The participants in the game who make choices
- Humans, firms, "nature", etc
- We assume players are /rational/
  - They can calculate outcomes from different strategies and will choose the optimum
- We assume players have /common knowledge of the rules/
  - Rules are fixed /at some level/
    - Example: Releasing tax returns when running for president
    - Example: Battle of wits
  - Whether or not to follow rules is /itself/ part of a larger game

* 
*Example*
Who are the players in a game of poker?

* 
*Strategies*
- The set of choices available to the player
- A complete strategy is a "map" (set of instructions) on how to play a game given any possible set of choices from the other players
- Strategies are collections of choices
- A strategy is complete if you could give your instructions to someone else (or a machine) to do

* 
*Payoffs*
- The outcomes of the game
- Can be profits, utility, money, wins and losses, etc
- In this class we will assume that higher payoffs are more desirable
- We will often need to calculate /expected payoffs/ if there is some randomness or uncertainty (imperfect information)
  - For any possible outcome $i$ with payoff $\pi_i$, expected payoffs are $\sum_i p_i \pi_i$, where $p_i$ is the probability of $i$ occurring 
* 
*Examples*
1. Suppose I flip a coin
  - Heads: You get $100
  - Tails: You lose $50
2. Suppose I flip 2 coins:
  - Heads/heads: You get $100
  - Heads/tails: You get $20
  - Tails/tails: You lose $40

* 
*Equilibrium*
- The outcome where nobody can do better by /unilaterally/ changing their strategy
- At equilibrium, nobody can say "I wish I had done that differently"
- Equilibrium does /not/ mean that the outcome is optimal
- We don't expect to always obtain an equilibrium
- There is /at least/ one equilibrium in every game

* 
*One half the average game*
What is an equilibrium of this game?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
- Everyone picks 0

* 
*Extra-credit game (choosing points)*
What is an equilibrium of this game?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) 
- Everyone chooses 1 point
- Any other equilibria?

* 
*Guess the average*
- Everyone write down a number between 0 and 100
- The winning number is the average number guessed
- Trade papers after writing down your number

# * 
# *Extra credit game, part 2*
# - Get a blank sheet of paper and write your full name at the top
# - You will choose to get either 2 points or 10 points extra credit on your first homework assignment
#   - If 2 or fewer people choose 10 points, everyone will get their chosen number of points
#   - If more than 2 people choose 10 points, /nobody/ gets any points
# - You can communicate with each other if you'd like (be respectful!)
# - I will not reveal the choices (but you can reveal your own...)
# - Bring your paper to the front when you've decided
