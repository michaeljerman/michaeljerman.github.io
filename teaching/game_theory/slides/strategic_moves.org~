* 
*Cheap Talk*
- Players may attempt to communicate their intentions before the game begins
- This adds a new first-stage to the game
- Communication may be /credible/ or /non-credible/

* 
*Strategic Moves*
- Any action that changes the rules of the game is a strategic move
  - Adding stages, changing payoffs, adding/removing choices
- Examples: Commitments, threats, promises 
- The goal of a strategic move is to alter subsequent stages to the advantage of a player
- Strategic moves must be /observable/ and /irreversible/

* 
*Unconditional strategic moves*
- Sometimes useful for players to /commit/ to a certain strategy 
  - "Whatever you choose, I am going to do /X/"
- Creates a first-mover advantage for the player
- Example: Extra-credit game (splitting points)
