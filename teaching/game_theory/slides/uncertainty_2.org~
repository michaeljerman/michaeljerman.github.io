* 
*Market for Lemons (Akerlof, 1970)*
- Two types of used cars: high quality and low quality ("lemons")
- Buyers cannot directly observe car quality
  - Willing to pay $6,000 for low quality
  - Willing to pay $16,000 for high quality
- Sellers know quality of their car
  - Value of high quality: $12,500
  - Value of low quality: $3,000

* 
*Buyers*
- Single market price for both cars $p$
  - Buyers can't observe quality, so only one market
- Suppose buyers can observe fraction of high quality cars in the market $f$
- Buyers will purchase a used car if $EV > p$

* 
*Sellers*
- High quality owners sell if $p>12,500$
- Low quality owners sell if $p>3000$
- When will high-quality cars be bought and sold on the market?

* 
*Market for high quality cars*
- What happens if $f$ falls below the critical value?
- Consumers would be willing to pay $p>12,500$ (if they were assured of getting high quality car)
- But sellers unable to find buyers at that price 
- No high quality cars will be bought or sold!
  - $f=0$
- Market price: $3,000<p<6,000$
