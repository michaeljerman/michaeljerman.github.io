* 
*Market for Lemons (Akerlof, 1970)*
- Two types of used cars: high quality and low quality ("lemons")
- Buyers cannot directly observe car quality
  - Willing to pay $6,000 for low quality
  - Willing to pay $16,000 for high quality
- Sellers know quality of their car
  - Value of high quality: $12,500
  - Value of low quality: $3,000

* 
*Buyers*
- Single market price for both cars $p$
  - Buyers can't observe quality, so only one market
- Suppose buyers can observe fraction of high quality cars in the market $f$
- Buyers will purchase a used car if $EV > p$

* 
*Sellers*
- High quality owners sell if $p>12,500$
- Low quality owners sell if $p>3000$
- When will high-quality cars be bought and sold on the market?

* 
*Market for high quality cars*
- What happens if $f$ falls below the critical value?
- Consumers would be willing to pay $p>12,500$ (if they were assured of getting high quality car)
- But sellers unable to find buyers at that price 
- No high quality cars will be bought or sold!
  - $f=0$
- Market price: $3,000<p<6,000$

* 
*Market failure*
- Sellers willing to sell high quality for $p>12,500$
- Buyers willing to buy high quality for $p<16,000$
- Market equilibrium is /inefficient/
  - Buyers /and/ sellers could be made better off without making anyone worse off

* 
*Adverse selection*
- Market for lemons is an example of /adverse selection/
- With imperfect information, one side must form expectations
- This can make $p$ low enough that some high-quality goods (or services) exit the market
- This reduces EV, further reducing price
- Only products that remain in market are low quality

* 
*Example: Health insurance*
- Health insurance providers do not know consumers' health as well as the individual
- Offer a single price to "similar" consumers
- Healthiest consumers may find price to be too high (expected utility greater without insurance)
- This reduces the average health of remaining consumers
- Insurance companies raise price to account for higher risk
  - Process repeats
- "Death spiral" -- market collapses
  - Rationale behind "individual mandate" and universal systems

* 
*Signalling*
- How do we overcome uncertainty and adverse selection?
- "Cheap talk" insufficient, no cost to lying about quality
- Quality signals must impose a cost on the player signalling in order to prevent "cheaters"
- Example: Product warranties
  - Used car dealers sometimes offer promises to repair a car if it breaks down 
  - Unlikely to offer warranty for lemons
- Example: Product design and marketing
  - Producers of high-quality products can "afford" fancy design and marketing

* 
*Screening*
- Why do employers value some majors higher than others?
- In general, degrees that are harder result in higher wages
- Employers know that "low quality" workers are unlikely to take hard classes
  - High quality workers may have an easier time, less of an investment
- This separates high-quality from low-quality workers
- Major choice is (partly) a /signal/ to employers 

* 
*Separating vs pooling equilibrium*
- Screening costs must be high enough to prevent low-quality players from cheating
- But screening costs must be /low/ enough to make it worth it for high-quality players to join
- If the screening costs are too high or too low, then all players will /pool/ together and be indistinguishable
- Examples: California food labeling laws vs "certified organic" labels
