#+TITLE: Mixed Games
#+AUTHOR: ECON 420: Game Theory
#+DATE: Spring 2018 

* 
*Mixed simultaneous and sequential games*
- Real world games are often combinations of sequential and simultaneous games
- We can use a combination of roll-back and best response analysis to find NE of these games

* 
*Simultaneous as sequential*
- Simultaneous games with multiple equilibria might have different outcomes if played sequentially (change the rules of the game)
- Payoffs may be better for one of the players depending on move order
  - First or second mover advantages

* Example: Chicken (6.5)

* Example: Tennis (4.14)

* Example: Monetary-Fiscal Policy Game (6.6a)

* 
*Expressing simultaneous games in extensive form*
- Simultaneous-move games don't actually require players to move at the same time
  - Players are simply unaware of what other player chooses when they make their choice
- We can use /information sets/ to describe this situation in simultaneous games
  - We draw a circle around nodes that are in the same information set
  - Players at a particular information set do not know which node they are at (within the set)

* Example: Tennis (4.14)

* 
*Expressing sequential games in normal form*
- Strategies are /complete plans of action/
- In a sequential game, this means we must describe the action of a player at /any possible node/ where they might move
- This includes actions on /off equilibrium paths/

* Example: Monetary-Fiscal Policy Game (6.6c)

* Subgame Perfect NE (SPNE)
- Some NE are supported by /threats/ of actions that may not be /credible/ if the player is actually made to choose at that particular node
- We can describe the NE outcomes that don't require threats as SPNE
- A /subgame/ is any possible "mini game" that results after any path of play
- The NE that are also NE for their respective subgames are SPNE
