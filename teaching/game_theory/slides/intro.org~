* Econ 311
- Agents have preferences over consumption bundles, choose bundle that optimizes their utility
- Generally consider prices and income to be /exogenous/
- Agents' consumption choices don't affect the choices of other agents
- Firms maximize profits subject to constraints
  - Perfect competition: Firms are /price takers/ -- individual production decisions don't affect prices
- These choices are called /decisions/: isolated choices that individual agents make given objectives and constraints
* Game theory
- Game theory is the study of how agents make choices in environments where the choices of others affects their outcomes /and/ their choices
- Examples:
  - Interactions with family and friends
  - Business decisions
  - Athletic competition
  - Board games
  - Political campaigns
  - Diplomacy
  - Warfare
  - Etc, etc, etc
