#+TITLE: Uncertainty
#+AUTHOR: ECON 420: Game Theory
#+DATE: Spring 2018

*Announcements* 
- Homework 3 on Canvas 
  - Due /Monday, May 21/
- Reading: Chapter 8

* 
*Uncertainty*
- So far: Strategic uncertainty
  - Some players unaware of the actions of other players
  - Example: Simultaneous-move games
- Today: External uncertainty
  - "Nature" changes aspects of the game
  - Players cannot control external uncertainty, must take it into account when making decisions 

* 
*Expected Utility Theory*
- Events that happen according to some probability distribution are called /gambles/ 
- Agents are able to rank gambles by comparing the /expected utility/ that they would receive from the potential outcomes of the gamble
- The utility that we will use is /von Neumann-Morgenstern (VNM)/ utility

* 
*Risk preference* 
- When there is uncertainty we can calculate the /expected value/ of a gamble
- But people do not just consider expected value when making decisions
- Some people might be willing to pay to avoid risk (risk aversion)

* 
*Example*
- Suppose I flip a coin. If heads, you get $100. If tails, you get $0. 
  - What is the expected value?
  - How much would you pay to play this game?
- Suppose instead the payoffs are $1 million for heads, $0 for tails. 

* 
*VNM Utility and Risk Preference*
- Outcomes are denoted $D$ (dollars)
- Agents in the model have preferences over outcomes represented by utility $u=u(D)$
- The risk preference of the agent depends on the concavity of the utility function $u$
- Agents with /diminishing marginal utility/ are risk averse
  - Concave utility function

* Risk aversion

* Risk seeking

* 
*Example*
- A farmer's crop yield depends on weather 
- Farmer gets good weather with 50%
- Yield with good weather is $160,000, yield in bad weather is $40,000
- Farmer has VNM utility $u(D) = \sqrt{D}$

* 
*Risk sharing*
- Risk averse agents willing to pay to remove risk 
- Agents can therefore benefit from trading /state-contingent claims/ with one another 
  - You agree to pay someone else if you have a good outcome, someone else pays you if you have a bad outcome

* 
*Example*
- Suppose there is another farmer that has the same weather probability and outcomes (weather probability is independent of first farmer)
- Farmers agree to a contract: If one farmer gets good luck and the other gets bad luck, lucky farmer pays $60,000 to the unlucky farmer
- Are the farmers better off?

* 
*Example*
- Now suppose the other farmer faces no uncertainty and will earn $100,000 with probability 1
- The farmer with risk is willing to accept their certainty equivalence instead of the gamble
- Is the riskless farmer willing to buy the risk in exchange for the certainty equivalence?

* 
*Example*
- Now suppose the farmer without risk is /risk neutral/
- What is the maximum that this farmer is willing to pay for the gamble?

* 
*Insurance and risk*
- Suppose there are thousands of farmers with identical risk/outcomes
- A single entity (insurance company) can buy the risk of all of the farmers and make them better off
- Law of large numbers says that the insurance company will earn the expected value of the gamble

* 
*Manipulating Risk*
- Sometimes agents have control over risk and can use it to their advantage
- By increasing risk, the probability of "tail events" increases
- This is why underdogs in sports often choose risky actions

* 
*Example*
- A basketball team scores 60 points per game on average
- They are playing a better opponent and must score at least 80 points to win
- How can this team maximize their chances of winning?

* 
*Cheap Talk*
- In coordination games, players may be able to costlessly communicate before the game begins
- This might allow players to better coordinate on preferred outcomes
