#+TITLE: Simultaneous Games
#+AUTHOR: ECON 420: Game Theory
#+DATE: Spring 2018 

* 
*Announcements*
- Homework due on Wednesday
- Reading: Chapter 4

* 
*Simultaneous games*
- Players move at the same time
- No knowledge of what other players choose when own choices are made
- Simultaneous games have /imperfect information/

* 
*Example*
- Your firm is competing against another firm (randomly matched)
- Your team is tasked with setting prices for you firm's product
  - You can choose a price of $5 or $10 per unit
  - Both firms are choosing price simultaneously
- Profits:
  - If both firms choose p=$10, profits are $8
  - If both firms choose p=$5, profits are $6
  - If one firm chooses $5 and the other chooses $10:
    - Firm that chooses $5 gets $10 profit
    - Firm that chooses $10 gets $5 profit

* 
*Strategies*
- Recall that strategies are /complete plans of action/
- In simultaneous games, only one choice can be made
  - Little difference between action and strategy
- But players may have a strategy that choose probabilistic actions
  - Example: Rock, paper, scissors
- For now, consider only /pure strategies/ (non-probabilistic) 

* 
*Game table*
- Simultaneous move games can be represented with a /game table/
- Contains information on players, strategies, and payoffs
- Games represented as game tables are said to be in /normal form/ (or /strategic form/)

* 
*Example: American football play*
- Offensive team chooses from among types of plays
- Defensive team simultaneously chooses type of play to counter offense
- Payoffs are zero-sum: whatever offense gains (in yards) is equal to what the defense loses

* Example: Pricing game

* 
*Best response*
- We can analyze simultaneous move games by describing player's /best response/ actions
- The best response is the action that maximizes a player's payoffs /given/ the action of the opposing player(s)
- /If/ the other player does X, /then/ I should do Y

* Suppose Row plays top:

* 
*Nash equilibrium*
- Nash equilibrium occurs when both players are /simultaneously/ choosing their best-response actions
- Neither player can achieve higher payoffs by changing their actions /given/ the action of the other player
- Not necessarily the best outcome for both players 

* Nash equilibrium: (Low, Middle)

* Still a Nash equilibrium?

* 
*Beliefs*
- How can a player choose a best "response" if they are playing simultaneously?
  - What are they responding to?
- Players form /beliefs/ about what other players will do
- At the Nash equilibrium:
  - All players choose optimal actions given their beliefs about what other players are doing
  - The beliefs are accurate
- If either condition doesn't hold, then not a Nash equilibrium

* Will Row play Low if they believe Column isn't playing Middle?
