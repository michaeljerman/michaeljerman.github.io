#+TITLE: Continuous Strategies and Rationalizability
#+AUTHOR: ECON 420: Game Theory
#+DATE: Spring 2018 


* 
*Announcements*
- Reading: Chapter 5 and 6
- Homework due next Monday
- Midterm exam next Wednesday


* 
*Continuous strategies*
- So far: Games with /discrete/ strategies
  - Choosing from a finite set of actions
- Many games have many (or infinite) available actions
- Can we generalize the notion of /best response/ to these settings?


* 
*Price-setting game*
- Suppose there are two competing restaurants (they make only one dish)
- Both firms must choose their prices $p_1$ and $p_2$
- The number of dishes each restaurant sells is $Q_i = 44 - 2p_i + p_j$
  - After a price change, half of your usual customers will leave to go to the other restaurant
- The dishes cost $8 to make for each restaurant
- Which price should each restaurant choose?

* 
*Best response*
- Profit depends on the pricing choice of the other firm
- Restaurants try to profit maximize given the price that they think the other will choose
- This pricing strategy is the /best response/ of the restaurant

* 
*Can the restaurants do better?*
- Suppose an outside company buys both restaurants
- The firm is now a monopolist, chooses one price for both locations
- What is the optimal price? What are the profits?

* 
*Collusion*
- The pricing game is a form of a prisoners' dilemma (with continuous strategies)
- The firms could cooperate to split the monopolist profits
- But each can do better (individually) by choosing something /other/ than the monopolist price
- Cooperation is /never/ a best response

* 
*Limitations of NE?*

Example:
- Player A: Chooses "Up" or "Down"
- Player B: Chooses "Left" or "Right"
- Payoffs (A, B):
  - Up, Left: (2 chocolates, 2 chocolates)
  - Up, Right: (1 chocolates, 1 chocolates)
  - Down, Left: (3 chocolates, 2 chocolates)
  - Down, Right: (50% penalty on midterm, 1 chocolate) 

* 
*Why might we not see a NE?*
- Often, player A won't choose Down, because it is risky
- Why is it risky?
  - A might think B doesn't like chocolate
  - A might be concerned the B will try to "spite" them
- These options might mean that the game is /misspecified/
  - A has uncertainty about B's payoffs

* 
*Rationalization*
- Suppose games are properly specified 
- Nash equilibrium:
  - The choice of each player is their best response given their beliefs about what the other players are doing
  - The beliefs are accurate
- Does this mean that purely rational players will achieve the NE?

* 
*Rationalizability*
- Multiple outcomes can be supported by rational "chains" of thought
  - Not necessarily NE
- But not /every/ outcome is supported by rationality
- For instance: It is never rational to play a strategy that is /never a best response/

* 
*Rationalizability*
- Note: Not all strategies that are never a best response are dominated by some other strategy
- Sometimes rationalizability can lead to a NE (but not always)
* 
*Cournot competition*
- Suppose there are two fishing boats that choose how many fish to catch each day
- The local fish market buys the fish for a price $P=60-Y$
- Boat one has costs of 30 per fish and boat 2 has costs 36 per fish
