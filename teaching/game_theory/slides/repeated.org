*Announcements*
- Homework 4 due next Wednesday (will be posted later today)
- Final exam: Friday, June 15 at 7:30am (!)

* Prisoners' Dilemma

[[./img/GAMES4_FIG10.01.jpg]]

* 
*Game 1*
- You will play the prisoners' dilemma against a random opponent 
- Write your name at the top of a sheet of paper
- Choose a strategy to play (Confess or Deny)
- Your opponent will be randomly selected from among your classmates
- The person(s) with the highest payoffs will receive 5 extra-credit points on the homework

* Restaurant Pricing Game

* 
*Game 2*
- Pair up with one of your classmates
- Play the restaurant pricing game for 5 rounds
  - Keep track of your payoffs for each round
 
* 
*Game 3*
- Play the restaurant pricing game again
  - Keep track of your payoffs each round
- Continue playing until I say stop 

* 
*Repetition and cooperation*
- Which version of the game are we most likely to observe cooperation? Why?
- Which version of the game are we /least/ likely to observe cooperation?

* The game tree

* 
*Strategies in repeated games*
- Strategies can be extremely complicated in repeated games 
  - Strategies can contain infinitely many moves if the game is repeated forever!
- Often useful to simplify the strategy to a "rule"
- /Contingent strategies/: Choose action based on action of opponent in previous round

* 
*Rollback equilibrium*
- Suppose the game is played a finite number of times
  - What is the rollback equilibrium?
- Suppose the game is played an infinite number of times
  - What is the rollback equilibrium?

* 
*Tit-for-tat*
- Strategy: Cooperate in first round, then do whatever opponent does in previous round
- Allows for cooperative outcomes, but "punishes" opponent for defecting

* 
*Grim-trigger*
- Strategy: Cooperate in every round if opponent also cooperates, defect forever if opponent defects once
- Most severe punishment for opponent

* 
*Time value*
- Suppose the restaurant pricing game is repeated monthly
  - Your opponent is playing a tit-for-tat strategy
- Should you defect in the first round?
  - Cooperate every round after
- Gain in the first month
- Lose /more/ in the second month
- But money is more valuable today than next month!

* 
*Present value*
- To compare money now with money later, we need to calculate the /present value/ of money later
- The PV of future money is the amount we'd be willing to accept today instead
- For a discount rate /r/, the present value of future income /I/ is 

$$PV = \dfrac{I}{1+r}$$

* Example

* 
*Defecting against a grim trigger*
- Receive the higher payoff at first, non-cooperative outcome forever after
- Is immediate payoff the long-run loss?
  - What is the immediate gain?
  - What is the PV of future losses?


* 
*Penalties and rewards*
- Perhaps there is a social cost to defecting (snitches get stitches?)
- In this case, the payoff table is poorly specified
- Properly specifying the payoffs may mean that the game is not a prisoners' dilemma at all
- Perhaps threats or promises in a new first round can change the payoffs of a game (chapter 9)

* 
*Experiments with repeated games*
- Robert Axelrod created a computer "tournament" where teams could submit computer programs to play a repeated prisoners' dilemma
- Teams chose a strategy for the programs, then they play other randomly selected programs
  - Which strategy was best?
- After first round, teams could submit /new/ strategies knowing what the optimum was
  - Which strategy was the best this time?

* 
*Axelrod*:
- "Don't be envious. Don't be the first to defect. Reciprocate both cooperation and defection. Don't be too clever."
