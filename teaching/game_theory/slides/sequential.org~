#+TITLE: Sequential Games

* 
** *Centipede game*
1. 2 players play for 10 rounds
2. Each round another unit of payoff is added to the pot (starting with one unit)
3. Players alternate turns, choose to either:
  1. Stop, and collect the entire pot for themselves
  2. Continue, one is added to the pot and next player chooses

* 
*Sequential games*
- Games where there is a strict order of play
- Games where players take turns moving are sequential
- Real-world games are generally combinations of sequential and simultaneous games
 
* 
*Game trees*
- We will visualize games using *game trees*
- Representing a game as a tree is known as the "extensive form" of a game
- The tree shows all components of a game: players, actions and strategies, payoffs

* 
*Nodes and branches*
- /Nodes/ are points on the tree where choices are made
  - The first node is called the /root node/
  - The last nodes (without branches) are /terminal nodes/
- /Branches/ show the actions available for the player to choose among at any node
- A node (and its branches) represent a "turn" for a player
- Payoffs are listed at the terminal nodes
  - Each player in the game gets a payoff at each node
  - Remember: Higher numbers are always better

* 
*External uncertainty*
- With external uncertainty, we introduce nature as a "player"
- Nature gets its own node, branches are possible outcomes
- Players calculate expected payoffs across the possible outcomes of nature's "choice"

* 
*Moves vs strategy*
- A choice of action at a node is called a /move/
- A strategy is a /complete plan of action/
  - A set of moves that will be performed if a certain situation arises
  - Strategies are collections of statements like "if /X/ then /Y/" for /any possible X/

* 
*Example*
- How many strategies does Ann have? 
- What are they?

* 
*Strategies*
- Strategies must include actions at /each node where a player can move/
- This includes the nodes that won't be reached if a player chooses a particular set of actions
- This is because hypothetical moves might help determine which moves should be chosen at earlier nodes
- Choices early in a game are affected by /expectations/ about what will happen later in the game

* 
*Finding equilibria in game trees*
- Consider one person's decision tree (is this a game?)
- The player (Carmen) is considering whether or not to start smoking
- Carmen first decides whether to start, then decides whether to continue
- What should Carmen do?

* 
*A decision tree as a game*
- Previous decision tree ignore that Carmen may become addicted if she starts smoking
  - Once addicted, quitting becomes worse (payoffs are lower)
- Carmen knows she may become addicted and that her payoffs might change if she starts smoking
- We can think of this as a game where the players are Carmen today and Carmen in the future (after the initial decision is made)
- Today's Carmen and future Carmen have different payoffs

* 
*Pruning*
- Starting at the end, we can "prune" the branches that we know will not be chosen
- When there is one action remaining at the final nodes, this means that the "final" decision moves back to the previous node (rollback)
- Starting at the end and moving backward by pruning allows today's Carmen to choose the best option for herself
- When all players use rollback analysis, the result of the game is called a /rollback equilibrium/

* 
*Smoking game*
- What are the rollback equilibrium strategies?
- Can either player do better by changing their strategies?

* 
*Three-player game*
- How many strategies does each player have?
- What is the rollback equilibrium?
- What are the rollback equilibrium strategies?

* 
*Example: Ultimatum game*
Player 1:
- Choose how to split 10 units so that both players get at least one unit
Player 2:
- Choose to either:
  1. Accept the split (you get what player 1 chooses for you)
  2. Reject the split (neither player gets anything)

* 
*Example: Centipede game*
- What does the game tree look like?
- What are the strategies for each player?
- What is the rollback equilibrium outcome?
- What are the rollback equilibrium strategies?
- Is this the outcome we observe in practice?

* 
*Limitations of rollback analysis* 
- Simple games can become difficult to express in extensive form 
  - How many moves does the first player have in tic-tac-toe?
  - How many moves does the second player have?
- Some sequential games are /impossible/ to express in extensive form!

*Chess*
- 400 possible positions (nodes) after each player moves once
- 9 million after the third move
- 288 billion after the forth move
- 40 move game: More possible positions than fundamental particles in the universe
