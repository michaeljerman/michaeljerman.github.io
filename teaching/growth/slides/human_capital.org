#+TITLE: Human Capital
#+AUTHOR: ECON 499: Growth and Development
#+DATE: Spring 2018 

* 
*Growth in the Solow model*
- Output (income) is created by combining labor and capital
- Capital accumulation increases income (workers become more productive)
- As workers save (invest) more, the have more capital to utilize in the future
- Solow model assumes labor is homogeneous, same across countries
- Given the same capital, does the average worker in North Korea have the same productivity as the average worker in Germany?

* 
*Human capital*
- /Human capital/ is a set of individual characteristics that affect the productivity of workers
- Not an exhaustive set (innate ability is /not/ considered human capital)
- Workers with high human capital are more productive
- Human capital can be changed, either through behavior or policy
- Examples: Health, education

* 	
*Properties of human capital*

Similar to physical capital, human capital is:
1. Productive
2. Produced
3. Earns a return (higher wages)
4. Depreciating
	  
* 
*Health*
- Healthy people can work longer, harder than unhealthy people
- Health human capital can be difficult to measure, must rely on "proxy" variables
- Height and available calories are commonly used proxies
- In 1855, 2/3 of Dutch men were shorter than 5'6'', less than 2% today

* 
*Malnourishment divide*
- Very few people are malnourished in the developed world
- Fogel (1997): 20% of adults in 1780 Britain did not have enough calories to provide energy to work 1 hour per day, contributed to 0.33% additional growth per year
- Malnourishment still a chronic problem in developing world
- In addition to calories, many lack essential vitamins and minerals, affects wages and ability to work, health outcomes

* 	
*Simultaneity of health and income*

Health and income are /simultaneously determined/
- Health can affect ability to earn income
- Income allows people to buy more food, health care, etc
- Creates multiplier effects, feedback between health and income
- Creates difficulty in measuring relative importance of health vs income

* 
*Example: Malaria debate*

Jeffrey Sachs:
- Countries that have eliminated malaria have grown much more rapidly than countries that have high malaria rates
- Malaria alone is responsible for a substantial portion of cross-country differences in growth and income
- Micro evidence suggests that eliminating malaria can have large effects on human capital acquisition, productivity

Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson:
- Countries differ in their /ability/ to combat malaria
- Countries that are able to eliminate malaria have strong institutions, care about public health
- Good institutions are responsible for growth and income, malaria reductions are a side effect
	

* 	
*Education*
- Obvious relationship between education and productivity, wages
- /Return to schooling/: income derived from an additional year of school
- Return is higher for early schooling (reading and writing marginally more valuable than learning how to solve the Solow model)
- Omitted variable bias?

* 
*Human capital share of wages*
- How much of national income rewards human capital?
- Alternatively, how large are the returns to education? How much cross-country difference can it explain?
- Using returns to wages and national education levels, we can divide amount of income going to "raw labor" and amount going to human capital

* 
*Education in the Solow model*
- Cross-country differences in education explain much (but not all) of the difference in income
- Model performs better for developed countries than developing countries
- Developing countries are poorer than they "should" be given educational differences

* 
*Quantity vs quality*
- Years of schooling might be a bad measure of human capital attainment
- 12 years in Sweden is different than 12 years in Mozambique
- Teachers in developing world often have less training, fewer textbooks and other resources, worse attendance (students and teachers)

* 
*Externalities*
- People invest in human capital and get a return in the form of higher wages
- Investing in human capital may impact *other* people as well (externality)
- Educated workers more likely to adopt technology, other workers can then use that technology
- Higher educated teachers can improve education of next generation
- Educated workers may innovate, accumulate capital
- Socially optimal education levels may be higher than levels chosen by fully rational people
