*Physical capital*
- Capital is a collection of things that workers use to produce output
- Workers can produce more with capital than without it
- Countries with more capital can produce more, have higher income

* 
*Properties of capital*
- Capital is:
  1. Productive
  2. Produced
  3. Rival
  4. Depreciating

* 
*Productive capital*
- Workers use capital to produce goods and services (machines, tools, factories, etc)
- More capital means workers are more productive
- Increasing capital per worker $\rightarrow$ increasing output per worker $\rightarrow$ increasing income per worker

* 
*Investment*
- Capital is itself produced by a production process
- Only things that are produced are capital (land is not capital)
- Resources that are used to produce capital are called /investments/
- There is a tradeoff between producing consumption goods and capital
- Consumers (and governments) either consume or save, therefore savings=investment (Keynesian IS curve)

* 
*Rivalry*
- If a hammer is being used by one worker, it cannot be used by another worker
- Capital has a finite capacity, not every worker can use the same capital equipment

* 
*Depreciation*
- Capital wears out (depreciates) over time
- Tools break, machines need maintenance, etc
- Some continued investment is needed to maintain a level of capital

* 
*The production function*
- Workers use capital to create consumption goods and services (and capital)
- A production function describes the way in which labor and capital can be combined to create output goods
- In mathematics, a /function/ transforms inputs (labor, capital) into output (GDP)

$$Y=F(K,L)$$

* 
*Assumptions*
- Constant returns to scale (CRS):
$$F(zK,zL) = zF(K,L)$$
- Diminishing marginal product: MPK and MPL diminish as additional units are added
