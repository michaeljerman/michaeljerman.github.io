*Explaining cross-country differences*
- So far: $Y_t = K_t^\alpha (h_tL_t)^{1-\alpha}$
- We've tried to explain cross-country differences in terms of population growth, physical capital, human capital
- Large differences remain 
- Factor accumulation alone not enough to explain differences in growth an income

* Physical Capital Predicted vs Actual

*Productivity*
- Some countries might be better at combining factors into output
- Technology, efficiency, work-ethic, etc
- How effective a country is at turning factors into output is called *productivity*
- Problem: Productivity is not directly observed, we must infer from other data using "accounting" techniques

*Productivity and income*
- A large amount of the difference in income across countries is explained by productivity differences
- Rich countries are more productive than poor countries
- Productivity and factor accumulation are (roughly) equally responsible for cross-country income differences

*Productivity and growth*
- Factor growth and productivity growth contribute to income per capita growth
- Productivity growth relatively more important at explaining differences in income growth
- Countries with lowest growth have negative productivity growth, despite positive factor growth
- Low-growth countries are getting *worse* at transforming factors into output over time
