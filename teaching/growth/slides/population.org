#+TITLE: Population and Growth
#+AUTHOR: ECON 499: Economic Growth and Development
#+DATE: Spring 2018 

* 
*Announcements*
- Reading
  - Chapters 4 
- Meet here on Thursday (no lab)
- Homework due on Thursday (uploaded to Canvas)
  - Expect technological "hiccups"

* 
*Population and growth*
- More people means more mouths to feed
- More people also means more workers
- How does production per capita respond to population growth?

*Malthusian model*
- Thomas Malthus (1766-1834)
- Productive resources are /scarce/, sometimes finite (land)
- As population increases, land per person decreases, making people worse off
- As poverty increases, people start dying and having fewer children, causing population to fall
- Population and income are self-regulating, mankind "stuck" at subsistence income level
- Malthus's solution: "Moral restraint"

* Breakdown of the Malthusian Model

*Explaining population growth*
- Solow model predicts that increased population growth can decrease income through capital dilution
- Population growth in Solow model is /exogenous/, determined outside the model
- Population growth usually modeled as /demographic transition/
- Developing countries go through mortality and fertility transitions as they develop

* 
*Mortality transition*
- Life expectancy at birth: number of years a newborn baby in a given year will live on average
- Most countries have seen life expectancy increase over last few centuries, beginning with developed countries
- Three factors:
  1. More plentiful, nutritious food
  2. Public health: sanitation, clean water, etc
  3. Medical technology

* 
*Fertility transition*
- Total fertility rate: number of children the each woman would have if she lived through child-bearing age
- Fertility rates decreased rapidly in developed world
- Decreasing in developing world, but still higher than developed world
- Possible explanations:
  1. Contraception
  2. Declining mortality
  3. Income and substitution effects
  4. Quantity/quality tradeoff

* 
*Contraception*
- Fertility rates began declining in developed world long before contraception was widely available
- Fertility in developing world decreasing contemporaneously with contraception
- Micro studies:
  - Making contraception available decreases number of offspring
  - Decreases unwanted pregnancies
  - Increases female "bargaining power", agency

* 
*Mortality reduction*
- Perhaps parents don't care about the number of children, but rather the number that survive to adulthood
- If mortality rates are high, parents will want more children to ensure more adult children
- Declining mortality rates will mean fewer children, effects likely delayed

* 
*Income and substitution effects*
- Rising income means people can afford more of everything, including children (income effect)
- Rising income means the opportunity cost of children is higher (substitution effect)
- If substitution effect dominates, people want fewer children as income rises
- In developing countries, female wages generally rise faster than male, substitution effect higher for women

* 
*Quantity/quality*
- Development increases opportunities for children
- Parents may invest more in children's education, knowing payoffs are higher
- This leaves less resources for other children
- Parents choose having fewer, higher quality children

* 
*Demographic transition*
- In general, mortality rates decline before fertility rates
- We can model population growth as a *demographic transition*
- Falling mortality rates give rise to increasing population until fertility declines as well

*Fertility in the developed world*
- Fertility rates in many developed countries are well below "replacement level"
- Should expect declining populations (Japan projected to lose 29% of population by 2055)
- Tempo effect: women delaying children can "artificially" reduce fertility rates but maintain constant population
- Increasing wages and political freedom for women can increase tempo effects

* 
*HIV/AIDS*
- 90% of infected people live in developing countries
- 5% of SSA infected (25% in Botswana)
- Reverses many of the mortality gains experienced elsewhere
- Life expectancy *decreased* 15 years in SSA

* 
*Aging*
- Declining mortality rates mean more people live into old age
- Declining fertility rates mean there are fewer children
- Median global age will increase 10 years by 2050
- Only workers create output, retired people don't work

*GDP per capita and aging*
- GDP per worker = GDP/(# of workers)
- GDP per capita = GDP/(total population)
$$\text{GDP per capita} = \dfrac{\text{GDP}}{\text{workers}} \times \dfrac{\text{workers}}{\text{population}}$$
$$\text{GDP per capita} = \text{GDP per worker} \times \dfrac{\text{workers}}{\text{population}}$$
- GDP per capita can decrease even as GDP per worker increases
