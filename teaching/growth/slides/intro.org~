* Reading
- This week: Chapters 1 & 2
- Next week: Chapter 3

* Homework problems
- Chapter 1 (page 24): 3, 5, 6
- Chapter 2 (pages 46-47): 4, 5

* Some facts
- 7.5 billion people alive
- 925 million (12%) people do not get enough food
- 824 million (11%) do not have access to clean water
- 2.5 billion (33%) lack sanitation
- 2.6 billion (35%) earn less than $2 per day

* Cross-country differences
- The people that live in the richest 20% of countries earns 60% of world income
- Australia has 687 automobiles per 1000 people, Bangladesh has 2

* Differences over time
- A Japanese baby born in 1880 could expect to live 35 years
- A Japanese baby born today can expect 83 years
- Americans spend 3 times as much on recreation as a hundred years ago (as fraction of total income), 1/3 as much on food
- Average workweek in 1870: 63 hours; today 34 hours
- 200 million fewer Chinese people earn less than $2 per day than they did 30 years ago

* Income and GDP
- Income is a good, but imperfect measure of well-being
- We can usually measure income across countries (GDP)
- Differences in income are vast, useful for understanding broad patterns in well-being
	  
* Real vs nominal GDP
- Nominal GDP is the price of all final goods and services produced within a country in a single year
- Equal to total income (everything that is bought is also sold)
- Price levels change: if all prices increase but we are not producing any more goods and services, nominal GDP will still increase
- Solution: use prices from the same year (2005)
- The **2005 price** of all goods and services produced within a country in a single year is /real GDP/

* Purchasing power parity (PPP)
- Prices in each country are denominated in local currencies
- Prices vary greatly across countries
- Solution: calculate the price of a common "basket" of goods in each country, use that price to convert GDP to a common currency (usually 2005 USD)
- In this class we will almost always use PPP adjusted real GDP numbers

* Pen's parade of global income
- Suppose we split national income equally among all inhabitants of each country, each person has the national average income (per capita GDP)
- Next suppose each person's height is proportional to their income, with average global income being an average height (6ft)
- Now sit in one place and watch the entire world march by in a parade lasting one hour

* First 7 minutes:
- Mostly Sub-Saharan Africans, height less than 1 foot.

* India and China:
- India begins walking by in the 13 minute, lasting 11 minutes
- Marchers are 23 inches tall
- China begins around 30 minutes (half-way)
- Marchers are 55 inches tall

* Average height (income)
- People with the average height start walking by around 45 minutes, after 3/4 of the world has walked by

* The giants
- 50 minute marchers are 9ft tall (Croatia)
- 52 minute marchers are 18ft tall (Japan)
- 55 minute marchers are 25ft tall (US)
- The last 15 seconds: Marchers range from 32ft to 95ft tall

* Growth
- A "rate of growth" is the /proportional/ change in a series over some length of time
- We will usually consider annual growth rates -- the rate of change over a year
- Example: China's growth rate of GDP was 6.7% in 2006. This means that China's GDP was 6.7% larger in 2006 than it was in 2005

* Growth and levels
- A constant growth rate means that a series is growing /exponentially/
- It is common to express exponential growth using a "ratio" (or "logarithmic") scale

* Rule of 72
- If a series grows at a rate g per year, the series will double in size every $\frac{72}{100*g}$ years $\left(\frac{72}{g\%}\right)$
- Example: Suppose Chinese GDP grows at 6% every year. Then GDP will double in $\frac{72}{100*0.06} = 12$ years

* Growth across countries
- The US shows remarkably constant growth historically
- In general, it is not the case that countries have constant growth
- The "rule of 72" shows how small differences in growth can translate into vastly different living standards
- Since 1870, US grew at an average of 1.8%, UK by 1.5%
- UK was 31% richer in 1870, 19% poorer today (per capita)

* Global growth facts
- There is a large variation in growth rates
- World income growth has accelerated over time
- The gap between rich and poor countries is accelerating as well
- Some countries seem to "transition" between growth rates

* Proximate vs fundamental causes
- The purpose of this course is to investigate what *causes* countries to have different growth rates
- Proximate causes: Things that are immediately responsible for growth, e.g. factor accumulation, investment rates, technology, efficiency
- Fundamental causes: Deeper causes of growth that determine proximate causes, e.g. culture, government, geography, institutions

* Using data
- Suppose we think that geography and fertility rates causally impact growth
- How can we determine if this is true?
- One possible solution is to plot the data and see if national income is correlated with our possible determinants

* Correlation and causality
Suppose we find that X and Y are correlated, and we suspect X causes Y. There are three possibilities:
1. X causes Y. If we change X, then we can expect Y to change as a result, just as we predicted.
2. Y causes X. "Reverse causality." If this is the case, then changing X will not influence Y. 
3. No relationship between X and Y. "Omitted variable bias." A third variable causes both X and Y, but changing X or Y will not influence the other. Only the omitted variable is causally related. 

* Determining causality
Suppose we want to determine the causal effect of X on Y
- Many econometric tools can be used to help determine causality
- Instrumental variables (IV): Find another variable Z that is correlated with X but not causally related to Y
- Randomized control trials (RCT): Randomly assign "treatment" and "control" groups. Change X in treatment group, compare Y to control group.
- It is difficult to randomize a "treatment" across countries, so IV is more common in growth economics. RCT more common in microeconomics, particularly in developing countries.
