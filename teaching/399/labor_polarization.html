	  # Labor Market Polarization

	  ## EC 399: Economics of Inequality

	  ## Spring 2017
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### So far:

	  - Top incomes have diverged rapidly since the 1980s

	  - Top incomes largely determined by market forces ("talent")

	  - How do people acquire talents?

	  - Why are "talents" more valued today than in the past?
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Changes in inequality

	  - Measure inequality with the 90/10 quantile ratio

	  - Since top 10% income share increasing (Piketty and Saez), expect 90/10 ratio to grow

	  - Similar to quantile ratio, compare relative wages of college educated vs non college educated

	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Skilled workers

	  - The supply of skilled workers has been increasing steadily

	  - 10% of workforce had college education in 1960

	  - 30% in 2005

	  - We would expect wages for skilled workers to decline

	<section>
	  <img src='img/autor_etal_fig5b.png' width=80% />
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### The skill premium

	  - The skill premium is the "reward" to education in the form of increased wages

	  - The wage premium has been increasing steadily

	  - Supply also increasing

	  - This means demand for skilled labor must be increasing at a faster rate
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Why Are There Still So Many Jobs? (Autor, 2015)

	  - Technology and "automation" have increased rapidly, yet unemployment doesn't seem to have changed

	  - Why hasn't automation created unemployment?
	  
	  - What are the implications of this technological change?

	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Automation

	  - Technology replacing jobs is not a new phenomenon

	  - Many agricultural jobs have been automated

	  - 41% of all workers in 1900, 2% today
	  
	</section>

	  <img src="img/farm_unemp.png" width=100% />
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Complements and substitutes

	  Complements:

	  - Factors that are used together in the production process

	  - Example: Programmers and computers

	  Substitutes:

	  - Factors that can replace one another

	  - Example: Farm worker, combine harvester
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Technology as a complement

	  - Some tasks are complemented by technological innovation

	  - Faster computers make programmers (and economists!) more productive

	  - ATMs allow bank tellers to do other work, e.g. customer service, sales, etc

	  - Workers have historically moved to technology-complementary industries as jobs are automated

	  - Increase in technology-complementary jobs offsets losses in substituted jobs
	</section>
	
	<section>
	  <img src="img/autor_jep_fig1.png" width=80% />
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Jobs that aren't substituted by technology

	  1. "Abstract" jobs: Problem solving, intuition, creativity. Professional, technical, managerial jobs.

	  2. "Manual" jobs: Adaptability, language recognition, human interaction. Food prep, service, healthcare jobs.
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Skills and jobs

	  - Abstract jobs usually require training and education

	  - Manual jobs can be learned "on the job", not as much education needed

	  - Jobs in the middle of the skill distribution are "hollowed out"

	</section>
	
	<section>
	  <img src="img/autor_jep_fig2.png" width=70% />
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Technology complements

	  - Not all jobs benefit the same from technology

	  - Computer programmers might benefit more from faster computers than bank tellers from ATMs

	  - Differences in productivities will be reflected in wages

	  - Which workers are complemented by technological innovations?

	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Skill-biased technological change

	  - Technological advances have complemented high-skilled workers more than low-skilled workers

	  - Computers allow doctors to diagnose better, lawyers to find laws better, financial analysts to model asset prices better, etc

	  - We say that technological change has been *biased* toward skilled workers

	  - Skilled workers receive more benefits from technology than other workers
	</section>

	<section>
	  <img src="img/autor_jep_fig4.png" width=78% />
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Middle-skill jobs

	  Break up "abstract" and "manual" jobs into routine and nonroutine categories:

	  1. Nonroutine abstract: Management and professionals

	  2. Nonroutine manual: Service, care providers

	  3. Routine abstract: Sales, support, office

	  4. Routine manual: Construction, manufacturing, mining
	</section>

	<section>
	  <img src="img/stlouisfed.jpg" width=90%/>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Trade and polarization

	  - Routine jobs are easily outsourced as well as easily automated

	  - Educated workers oversees compete against domestic workers for routine jobs

	  - Growth of India and China has greatly increased the supply of foreign workers who can perform routine jobs
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Global vs local inequality

	  - The rise of China and India has vastly reduced global income inequality

	  - With growth comes new workers that can compete in global market

	  - This hollows out middle skill, routine tasks

	  - Makes inequality increase in developed countries
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Returns to education

	  - If returns to education are so high, why doesn't everyone get advanced degrees?

	  - Returns to education high enough to make student debt "worth it"

	  <img src='img/avery_fig5b.png' width=80%/>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Credit constraints

	  - High-income students might have better access to credit markets

	  - More students are dependent on private student loans in addition to Government loans

	  - Private loans are often not available to low-income students
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Increasing value of leisure time (speculative)

	  - "The Free-Time Paradox in America", Atlantic Magazine, September 2016 (link on Canvas)

	  - Low skill, young men work much less today than in the past

	  - 3/4 of additional leisure time is spent playing video games

	  - "Life satisfaction" surveys indicate they are just as happy
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Consumer surplus and leisure

	  - Entertainment goods are much cheaper today than in the past

	  - People are willing to pay high amounts for entertainment, but prices are low

	  - Internet based goods are very low cost (Wikipedia, Netflix, Facebook)

	  - The same level of income can buy more utility (satisfaction)

	  - Some people might be less willing to work hard to become rich (marginal utility of income is lower)
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Summary

	  - Automation and trade replace jobs that require some skill

	  - High skill and low skill jobs not replaced by automation or trade

	  - Technology is "biased" toward high-skilled jobs, increasing wages

	  - High skilled and low skilled workers are pulled apart

	  - Some low skilled workers might be content to not acquire skills (speculative!)
