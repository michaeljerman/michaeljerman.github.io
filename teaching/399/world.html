	  ### How does growth affect inequality?

	  - Does inequality go up or down as countries get richer?

	  - Kuznets: Inequality goes up, then goes down

	  ### Growth and inequality

	  - In the cross section it does not appear the wealthier countries have lower inequality

	  - We would like know how inequality evolves as countries develop

	  - We don't have great data on this!

	  ### Growth and inequality

	  - Growth doesn't appear to make top incomes diverge among developing countries

	  - What about low income? Are people "left behind" by development?

	  - We can look at poverty rates

	  ### Poverty

	  - Poverty has fallen dramatically at a global level

	  - Poverty reductions in China and India (35% of global population) are important cause

	  - Poverty in sub-Saharan Africa has not changed much
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Between-country inequality

	  - Global inequality has been falling

	  - Within-country inequality has been (relatively) constant

	  - Between country inequality must be falling

	  - Poor countries must be growing faster than rich countries
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Exponential growth

	  "Rule of 70"

	  - Imagine income grows at an exponential rate g% per year

	  - Income will double in 70/g years

	  - USA: g=2.5% $\rightarrow$ average income doubles every 28 years (the average person has twice as much income as their parents at the same age)

	  - China: g=7% $\rightarrow$ average income doubles every 10 years

	  - Lucas (1988): "Once one starts to think about [economic growth], it is hard to think about anything else."

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Solow growth model

	  - Workers consume part of their income, save the rest

	  - Savings are capital investments for firms (banks loan out savings)

	  - Capital is productive, makes workers more efficient $\rightarrow$ wages increase

	  - Workers save more, causing capital to increase, etc...

	  - Diminishing marginal returns to capital: Eventually additional capital will not have much of an effect on productivity, growth levels off

	  - "Steady state:" Capital and income grow at a constant rate, determined by technological growth
	</section>

	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Convergence

	  - Technology is easily transferable, so steady state growth should be the same in every country

	  - Countries with below steady-steady state capital should grow faster than countries at steady state

	  - Poor countries should grow faster than rich countries
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Conditional convergence

	  - Countries that are similar to each other tend to converge in income

	  - What are those similarities?

	  - Politics, education, institutions, technology, etc
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Summary
	  
	  - Decreases in inequality at global level driven by India and China

	  - Solow model predicts growth of middle income countries will eventually slow down (converge)

	  - Poor countries may be "left behind" unless they figure out how to grow

	  - Low growth rates in poor countries means that the gap between rich and poor will get larger over time
