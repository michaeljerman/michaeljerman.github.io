	  # Economic Growth

	  ## EC 399: Economics of Inequality

	  ## Spring 2017
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Global inequality

	  - Most international inequality is *between* country, not *within* country

	  - Some regions grow faster than others

	  - Different growth rates can increase global inequality

	  - "Rule of 70:" Small changes in growth rates can have large effects on income and inequality
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Simple Solow

	  Aggregate production:

	  - Suppose output (GDP) is produced only with capital (machines)

	  - Assume labor is constant (no population growth, no unemployment)

	  - $Y = f(K)$

	  - $f'(K) < 0$: Diminishing marginal productivity of capital
		     
		    (Picture 1)
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Simple Solow, cont.

	  Capital law of motion:

	  - Capital depreciates at a constant rate $\delta$

	  - Machines wear out, need to be replaced periodically

	  - Everything we don't consume becomes capital

	  - Change in capital $= Y - C - \delta K$

	  - $\dot{K} = sf(K) - \delta K$
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Capital and growth

	  If $\dot{K}=0$:
	  - Capital is constant

	  - Producing just enough to replace depreciated capital
	  
	  - Then $Y=f(K)$ is constant $\rightarrow$ $Y$ is constant

	  If $\dot{K} > 0$:

	    - Capital is increasing

	    - $Y=f(K)$ is increasing $\rightarrow$ growth

	    Growing capital stock $\rightarrow$ growing income

	    		    (Picture 2)
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Steady state

	  - Diminishing marginal productivity of capital ensures that we always return to $\dot{K}=0$

	  - This is our *steady state* level of capital, $\bar{K}$

	  - If you start below steady state, capital and income decreases until you get to $\bar{K}$

	  - If you start above steady state, capital and income increase until you get to $\bar{K}$

	  - The further away from the steady state, the faster the convergence

	(Picture 3) 
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Poverty traps

	  - Suppose a country has access to two separate production technologies ("traditional" and "modern")

	  - The country must achieve a certain level of development before it can take advantage of modern technology

	  - The traditional steady state may prevent country from developing to the level necessary to use modern technology

	  (Picture 4)
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Convergence

	  - The steady-state level of capital is determined by the shape of the production function and the savings rate

	  - Countries with different production processes and different savings rates will have different steady-states

	  - This explains why we don't observe absolute convergence

	  (Picture)
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Adding steady-state growth

	  - In the simple model there is no growth in the steady state

	  - Data suggests that most countries have positive growth in the steady state

	  - We might think that our production process $f(K)$ gets better over time

	  - We can add an *exogenous* technology process $A$ that increases productivity

	  - $Y = Af(K)$
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Technological change

	  - Suppose $A$ grows at some constant rate $g$

	  - Then at the steady state, $Y$ is growing at the same rate

	  - $Y = Af(\bar{K})$

	  - $\bar{K}$ constant, $A$ grows at $g$, $\rightarrow$ $Y$ grows at rate $g$

	  - Capital accumulation happens as before
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Convergence

	  - If you start below $\bar{K}$, you will grow faster than $g$ until you get to the steady state

	  - If you start above $\bar{K}$, you will grow slower than $g$ until you get to the steady state

	  - Converge to a steady-state level of growth

	  (Picture)
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Steady-state determinants

	  - Different countries/regions seem to grow at different rates

	  - What determines a country's steady state?

	  - What can low-income countries do to grow faster?

	</section>

	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Human capital

	  - So far we've only considered physical capital ($K$)

	  - The ability to efficiently use capital and technology a function of worker ability or skills (human capital)

	  - Countries with more human capital (education) have a higher steady state, will grow faster than countries with lower human capital from the same initial level of wealth
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Other possibilities

	  - Rule of law

	  - Openness to trade

	  - Democracy

	  - Fertility rate

	  - Government spending

	  - Health

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Conditional convergence

	  - Controlling for observable characteristics, countries with higher initial income grow slower than countries with lower income

	  ### Fundamental causes of growth

	  - Many factors that correlate strongly with growth seem to be related

	  - There are likely some underlying factors that are causing everything

	  - If human capital creates growth, why don't all countries improve human capital? (Fertility, health outcomes, etc.)

	  - North and Thomas (1973):

	  > The factors we have listed ... are not causes of growth, *they are growth*
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Fundamental causes?

	  1. Luck

	  2. Geography

	  3. Culture

	  4. Institutions
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Luck

	  - Poverty trap model: Steady state income depends on initial level of capital

	  - What determines initial capital?

	  - Some countries may be lucky or unlucky

	  - Natural disasters can push countries to a low steady-state path early in development process
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Arguments against luck

	  It seems unlikely that the vast differences between the United States and Nigeria can be explained only by small, random occurrences

	  Are we stuck with randomness?

	  - If yes, then there's nothing we can do about growth!

	  - If no, then why don't poor countries do something about it?
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Geography

	  - Jared Diamond: *Guns, Germs, and Steel* (1997)

	  - Some climates more conducive to agriculture

	  - Tropical diseases

	  - Natural resources

	  - Strong correlation between latitude and wealth
	</section>
	
	<section>
	  <img src="img/acemoglu_geo.png" width=100% />
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Arguments against geography

	  - Countries diverge after industrialization, not during agricultural times

	  - Low agriculture should create comparative advantage in industry

	  - Diseases are caused by wealth: Richer countries can afford to eliminate disease (black plague in Europe, malaria in US South)
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Culture

	  - Max Weber: *The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism* (1905)

	  - Protestantism values hard work and capital
	  
	  - Some cultures more trusting, harder working than others (?)
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Arguments against culture?

	  - What is "culture"? How do we measure it?

	  - How do we account for similar cultures with vastly different growth/wealth? (North and South Korea, Nogales Sonora, Nogales Arizona)
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Institutions

	  - New-institutional economics (Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson: *Why Nations Fail* (2012))

	  - Douglass North (1990): "Institutions are the rules of the game in a society or, more formally, are the humanly devised constraints that shape human interaction."

	  - Institutions explain many facts that other explanations struggle with

	  - Extreme example: North and South Korea
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Reversal of fortunes

	  - Many European colonies that were rich in 1500 are poor today

	  - Many that were poor in 1500 are rich today

	  - Opposite is true among non-colonies

	  - Difficult to explain by geography, luck, or culture

	</section>
	
	<section>
	  <img src="img/acemoglu_reversal2.png" />
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### The reversal and institutions

	  - Institutions can explain the reversal of fortune among former colonies

	  - Colonies that are rich today have "better" institutions than colonies that are poor today
	</section>
	
	<section>
	  <img src="img/acemoglu_exprop.png" />
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Colonies and institutions

	  - All colonies had an institutional change when thy were colonized
	  
	  - Some colonies got "better" institutions than others

	  - What decides if a colony got better institutions?

	  Note: "Better" in terms of economic growth only!
