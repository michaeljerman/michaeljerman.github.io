	  # Introduction

	  ## EC 399: Economics of Inequality

	  ## Spring 2017
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Thinking about inequality: Pen's parade

	  - Suppose each person's height is proportional to their income (in the US)
	  - People with 0 income are invisible
	  - People with the average income are average height (5'10'', 177cm)
	  - Everyone lines up for a parade, and we sit in one place and watch them walk by at a constant speed
	  - The entire parade lasts 1 hour
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  The first people to walk by are invisible
	  - People with negative incomes from business losses
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  After 10 minutes, the people are 11 inches (27 cm) tall
	  - 1/12 of the population earns less than \$9,500 per year
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  Halfway through, the people are 3'4'' (103 cm) tall
	  - Half the population earn less than \$36,000 per year (median income)
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  After 42 minutes, we finally see people with the average height
	  - 70% of the population earn less than the average
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  At 50 minutes, the people are 9 feet tall (277 cm)
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  At 57 minutes, the people are 28'6'' (871 cm) tall
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  With 6 seconds left in the parade, the people are 342 feet (104 meters) tall 
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  With 1 second left, people are 480 feet (146 meters) tall
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  The last few people in the parade are 11,500 feet (3.5 km) tall
	  - Mt Hood: 11,250 feet
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### In this class we will try to answer four questions about economic inequality:

	  1. What is it?
	  2. What causes it?
	  3. What are the consequences?
	  4. How do we reduce it?
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### 1. What is inequality?

	  "Economic" inequality:
	  - Income vs wealth
	  - Individual vs household
	  - Adults vs children

	  Other outcomes:
	  - Race
	  - Gender
	  - Health	  	  
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### What do we mean when we say "inequality?"

	  - We know what "no inequality" looks like
	  - We (probably) know what "perfect inequality" looks like
	  - In between, what does it mean for one distribution to have "more inequality" than another?
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### An example

	  - Consider an "economy" with five agents, each with a different amount of resources (income, wealth, etc)
	  - Can we compare distributions?
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Example 1
	  #### Which distribution has more inequality?
	  
	  #### Distribution A:

	  | Obie | Michael | Llewelyn | Rudy | Kitty |
	  |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
	  |2|5|9|20|30|

	  ---
	  
	  #### Distribution B:

	  | Obie | Michael | Llewelyn | Rudy | Kitty |
	  |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
	  |2|6|8|20|30|

	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Example 2
	  #### Which distribution has more inequality?
	  
	  #### Distribution A:

	  | Obie | Michael | Llewelyn | Rudy | Kitty |
	  |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
	  |2|5|9|20|30|

	  ---
	  
	  #### Distribution B:

	  | Obie | Michael | Llewelyn | Rudy | Kitty |
	  |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
	  |2|6|9|19|30|

	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Example 3
	  #### Which distribution has more inequality?
	  
	  #### Distribution A:

	  | Obie | Michael | Llewelyn | Rudy | Kitty |
	  |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
	  |10|10|10|10|30|

	  ---
	  
	  #### Distribution B:

	  | Obie | Michael | Llewelyn | Rudy | Kitty |
	  |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
	  |10|10|10|20|20|

	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### 2. What causes inequality?

	  On one side:
	  - Immigration
	  - Unnecessary regulations
	  - Welfare discourages work
	  - Excessive taxation
	  - Obamacare

	  On the other side:
	  - Barriers to education
	  - Corrupt executives
	  - Taxes too low for the wealthy
	  - Technology and automation
	  - Access to health care
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### 3. What are the consequences of inequality?

	  - Is inequality bad for the economy?
	  - What does it mean for something to be "bad for the economy?"
	  - How do economists think about the well-being of a society?
	  
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  
	  ### Do we care about inequality?

	  The LeBron James parable (Robert Nozick, *Anarchy, State, and Utopia*, 1974):

	  - Suppose resources are equally distributed among everyone in the economy
	  - Now suppose that one of the people in our economy is LeBron James
	  - Lebron decides that he will only play basketball if everyone that comes to see him pays \$1
	  - If 1 million people pay to see Lebron, then he has \$1 million more than everyone else
	  - If people choose to watch LeBron, then is there any injustice? Is LeBron entitled to keep his extra money?

	  
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  - These philosophical issues are largely beyond the scope of this course
	  - These issues are largely beyond the scope of economics!
	  - We will need to be careful whenever we use terms like "better" or "worse."
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### 4. How do we reduce inequality?

	  - Minimum wage?
	  - Basic income?
	  - Cash assistance?
	  - Education?
	  - Taxation?
