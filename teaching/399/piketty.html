	  # Piketty's *Capital*

	  ## EC 399: Economics of Inequality

	  ## Spring 2017
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### *Capital in the Twenty-First Century*

	  - Thomas Piketty (2013)

	  - 700 pages
	  
	  - Past, present, and future of inequality

	  - \#1 on the New York Times Best Seller list
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Income vs Wealth

	  Income is a *flow* variable, measured in units per unit of time

	  - Dollars per hour, thousands of dollars per year, etc

	  Wealth is a *stock* variable, measured as a total amount

	  - Amount of money in your bank account

	  - Value of assets you own
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Capital income

	  - Wealth is a source of income

	  - S=I

	  - Capital income increases as wealth increases

	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### 3 facts

	  1. Labor income inequality is higher in the US than in Europe, opposite of 1900

	  2. Wealth inequality more concentrated than income inequality

	  3. Wealth to income ratios are U-shaped in Europe, flat in US

	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  > The United States is the land of booming top labor incomes; Europe is the land of booming wealth (albeit with a lower wealth concentration than in the United States). These are distinct phenomena, involving different economic mechanisms and different parts of the developed world.
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Wealth/income ratio

	  Solow model:

	  - $Y=f(K)$

	  - Steady state: $\bar{K} \rightarrow f(\bar{K})=\bar{Y}$

	  - Long-run wealth/income ratio: $\bar{K}/\bar{Y}$

	  - With steady-state growth, $K/Y$ is still constant (both K and Y grow at same rate)
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Piketty's "first fundamental law of capitalism"

	  $$\text{Capital share of income}=\alpha =r\dfrac{K}{Y}$$

	  - Just a definition
	  
	  - $r$ is the return on capital 

	  - $rK$ is capital income per year

	  - $rK/Y$ is share of capital income to total income (Y)
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Piketty's "second fundamental law of capitalism"

	  $$\dfrac{\bar{K}}{\bar{Y}} = \dfrac{s}{g}$$

	  - $s$ is the savings rate, $g$ long-run growth rate

	  - Can be shown using Solow model

	  Intuitively:

	  - $\dot{K} = sY$ (K = net capital)

	  - Rate of change of K is g

	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Example

	  $s=0.10$

	  - $g=0.03$:

	  $$\dfrac{\bar{K}}{\bar{Y}} = \dfrac{0.1}{0.03} = 3.33$$

	  - $g=0.015$:

	  $$\dfrac{\bar{K}}{\bar{Y}} = \dfrac{0.1}{0.015} = 6.66$$

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### US wealth/income ratio

	  Why is US not seeing accumulating wealth?

	  - Population growing faster in US (causes growth)

	  - Savings rate lower in US
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### $r-g$

	  - Suppose two people in society: one with capital income, one with labor income

	  - Labor income grows at rate $g$

	  - Capital income grows at rate $r$

	  - If $r>g$, capital income accumulates faster than labor income

	  - Capital begets capital (part of capital income is saved), so wealth inequality increases

	</section>
	
	<section>
	  <img src='img/piketty_saez_fig4.png' />
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Putting it all together

	  - Lower growth rates cause $K/Y$ to increase

	  - Capital share increases ($rK/Y$)

	  - $r>g$: capital incomes diverge from labor incomes

	  - Wealth more concentrated than labor income
	</section>

	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Labor and capital

	  - Most of current inequality is caused by labor, not capital

	  - High wage-earners are able to save more of their incomes, accumulate capital

	  - We might expect top wage earners to transition to capital earners
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### First law

	  $$\alpha =r\dfrac{K}{Y}$$

	  If $K/Y$ increasing to steady state, will $\alpha$ increase?

	  - If $r$ goes down, then capital share of income may not decrease

	  - If $r$ stays the same or goes up, then capital share will increase
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### What determines $r$?

	  - $r$ is the return on capital

	  - With competitive markets, equal to the marginal productivity of capital (MPK)

	  - MPK is a function of level of capital (-) and technology (+)

	  - "Capital augmenting" technology can keep $r$ high in the long run

	  - Solow, 2014:

	  > There is no logical necessity for the rate of return to exceed the growth rate...but there is no invisible hand to steer a market economy away from this perversity. 
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Capitalism and inequality

	  - Piketty shows that there is no "law" of capitalism that ensures inequality will fall

	  - Capital income can be derived from skilled investing, but unskilled investing can earn high income if wealth is high

	  - Increasing wealth might imply increasing inherited wealth
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Patrimonial capital

	  - Wealth is inherited from parents

	  - You can earn capital income simply because your parents earn capital income (no skills required!)

	  - This was the case for most of history, until 20th century

	  - Piketty argues that the 20th century is an anomoly, driven by negative capital shocks (world wars) and high growth (convergence)

	  - $r>g$ implies a return to patrimonial capitalism, widening gulf between capital and labor

	  > The reason why wealth today is not as unequally distributed as in the past is simply that not enough time has passed since 1945.
	  
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Criticisms

	  - Causes of the rising capital share
	  
	  - Does $r>g$ lead to rising inequality?
	  
	  - Is inequality good for the economy?

	</section>

	<section>
	  <img src="img/alpha.png" />
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Rising capital share

	  Putting the two laws together:

	  $$ \alpha = r\dfrac{s}{g} $$

	  - r, s, and g not enough to explain rise in capital share
	  
	  - Evidence suggests that rising capital share is due rising home prices, not a return on capital investments
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### $r-g$ in theory

	  - $r>g$ does not necessarily imply more inequality

	  - Small amounts of social mobility mean $r>g$ can lead to a *decrease* in inequality

	  - High returns on capital encourage people to save more, accumulate wealth
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### $r-g$ in history

	  - Piketty does not show any correlations between $r-g$ and inequality
	  
	  From 1870 to 2012:

	  - Increases in $r-g$ are not associated with rising top income share

	  - Same holds for many definitions of $r$

	  - No long term effects in the data either
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Capital mobility and capital returns

	  - Capital is generally very mobile across national boundaries

	  - The rich can earn a high return even if there are low returns in their home country

	  - Returns should equalize across countries

	  - Wealth accumulation should occur everywhere

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### South Africa and Sweden

	  - Both countries capitalist
	  
	  - Inequality in SA much different than inequality in Sweden

	  - SA inequality was/is institutionalized (apartheid)

	  - Changes in inequality reflect changes in institutions more than $r-g$
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Is inequality good for the economy?

	  Mankiw (2013): "Defending the One Percent" (on Canvas)
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### LeBron James parable

	  - Steve Jobs improved the economic well being of many people

	  - Was compensated very well for his efforts

	  - Is it bad that he accumulated wealth?
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Equality of opportunity

	  - Inequality is bad if it means unequal access to opportunity

	  - Great Gatsby curve, Moving to Opportunity, etc

	  - Genetics likely play a large part
	  
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Genetics and economic outcomes

	  - Studies on twins (same genes) raised in separate households suggest genes factor heavily into economic outcomes

	  - Low intergenerational mobility is largely due to genes, rather than environment

	  - Unequal opportunity more relevant at lower incomes, not higher incomes
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Equity-efficiency tradeoff

	  - Governments cannot observe genetic productivity

	  - Some high-productivity people might want to work very little

	  - Society loses if productive people work less

	  - Since government cannot distinguish lazy from low productivity, redistribution may encourage some productive workers to work less

	  - Some inequality is therefore preferred 
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Solow's response to Mankiw (on Canvas)

	  > The cheerful blandness of Gregory Mankiw’s "Defending the One Percent" may divert attention from its occasional unstated premises, dubious assumptions, and omitted facts. I have room to point only to a few such weaknesses; but the One Percent are pretty good at defending themselves, so that any assistance they get from the sidelines deserves scrutiny.
