	  # Inequality in the United States

	  ## EC 399: Economics of Inequality

	  ## Spring 2017
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### What is inequality?

	  - We now know how to think about inequality theoretically

	  - How do we measure inequality?

	  - What can the data tell us?

	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  
	  ### Kuznets hypothesis

	  - Poor countries have homogeneous labor, mostly agriculture

	  - As countries develop, cities become industrial centers

	  - Creates urban/rural wage gap, increasing inequality

	  - As development increases, rural workers become educated and move to cities

	  - Reduces supply of rural workers, increases wages, decreases inequality
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Piketty and Saez (2003)

	  - "Income inequality in the United States, 1913-1998"

	  - One of the first papers to estimate long-run evolution of inequality

	  - Two of the most prominent empirical researchers

	  - Renewed economists interest in inequality

	  - Much of these findings are included in Piketty's famous book (which we will talk about later)
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Data

	  - Tax return statistics reported by IRS

	  - Most people did not pay income tax prior to 1944, so focus on top 10%

	  - Gross income: Wages, profits, dividends, interest, rents, etc

	  - Exclude capital gains (people don't sell assets every year, therefore it is "lumpy")

	  - Calculated before any taxes, deductions, or transfers

	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### The fall in inequality 

	  - World War II funded primarily through corporate income tax
	  - Top incomes were mostly earned through capital income
	</section>

	</section>

	<section>
	  <img src="img/piketty_fig5.png" width=90%>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Declining capital incomes

	  - Capital incomes for the top income earners have declined steadily since WWII

	  - Capital income is derived from wealth

	  - After WWII ended, why did capital incomes not recover to previous levels?
	  
	  - Why are the wealthy not earning as much capital income today?
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Progressive taxation: A possible explanation

	  - Pre WWI taxes are relatively flat, allowed wealth to accumulate

	  - Great depression and WWII "shocks" decreased the wealth of the top earners

	  - Progressive taxation and corporate taxes prevented wealth from accumulating to previous levels
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### The rise in inequality after 1970

	  - Primarily labor income

	  - Tax Reform Act of 1986: Top marginal tax rate changed from 50% to 28%

	  - Raised to 39.6% by 1993

	  - Initial cut coincides with rapid growth of top incomes
	</section>

	<section>
	  <img src="img/piketty_fig9.png" width=90%>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### A mystery?

	  - It's not clear from the data what is causing the rapid rise in top incomes

	  - Piketty and Saez speculate that changing social attitudes toward executive pay may be a factor
	</section>
	
	<section>

	</section>

	<section>
	  <img src="img/piketty_fig12.png" width=85%>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Critiques of Piketty and Saez

	  - Only looking at income in the top 10%, ignoring inequality elsewhere in the distribution ("transfer sensitivity" principle)

	  - The unit of observation is the "tax unit", not weighting observations by number of people, children, etc

	  - Their definition of income ignores non-market sources
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### What is income?

	  Piketty and Saez:
	  - Salaries and wages
	  - Capital gains

	  Other sources:
	  - Benefits
	  - Taxes
	  - "In kind" transfers

	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Market vs comprehensive income

	  Market income:
	  - The pre-tax compensation earned in exchange for selling labor
	  - Income from capital: profits, interest, etc
	  
	  Comprehensive income:
	  - Market income plus "everything else"
	  - The total money received that can be used to purchase goods and services
	</section>


	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Healthcare

	  - A large non-market source of income
	  - People need to consume health services whether or not they have insurance
	  - Employer-provided insurance isn't included in wages, by allows people to consume more than they otherwise could
	  - Kaestner and Lubotsky (2016), optional on Canvas
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Healthcare facts

	  - Healthcare expenses were 17% of GDP in 2014
	  - 70% of expenses paid by public or private insurance (not out-of-pocket)
	  - 36% of all expenses paid by Federal programs Medicaid and Medicare
	  - Average Medicaid recipient receives \$9,125 per year (family of 3)
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Medicare

	  - Covers nearly all citizens age 65 and older
	  - Covers some disabled citizens under 65
	  - Financed by 2.9% payroll tax (+0.9% for high income earners)
	  - Average beneficiary receives \$11,400 
	  - Adults over 65 generally have lower income than those under 65
	  - Transfer from relatively high incomes to lower incomes
	  - Reduces inequality (principle of transfers)
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Medicaid

	  - Provides insurance for low income families
	  - Covers 60 million people
	  - Reduces inequality 
	</section>

	<section>
	  <img src="img/kaestner_tab1.png" width=90%>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Affordable Care Act

	  - Allows states to expand Medicaid coverage (many don't)

	  - Offers subsidies to people with less than 400% federal poverty level

	  - Increased the coverage for low-income workers

	  - Reduces inequality
	</section>
	
	<section>
	  <img src="img/kaestner_tab2.png" width=90%>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Employer provided healthcare

	  - Most middle and high-income earners receive insurance through their employer

	  - Employee contributions untaxed -- increases income of middle and top earners

	  - Increases inequality
	</section>
	
	<section>
	  <img src="img/kaestner_fig1.png" width=85%>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Question:

	  In terms of well-being, is \$5,000 per year in healthcare subsidies the same as an additional \$5,000 in wages?
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Armour et al (2014)

	  - "Levels and Trends in U.S. Income and its
	  Distribution: A Crosswalk from Market
	  Income towards a Comprehensive
	  Haig-Simons Income Approach"

	  - How do different definitions of income change our measured inequality?

	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Haig-Simons income

	  - Income is the amount of consumption plus the change in net worth

	  - Emphasizes consumption over market income

	  - A better representation of well-being
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Data

	  - Census Bureau's Current Population Survey, March supplement (March CPS)

	  - Survey data, asks respondents about *all* sources of income (minus capital gains)

	  - Health insurance status asked, and source of health insurance

	  - Health insurance premiums not captured, and are calculated by the Census Bureau

	  - Incomes are "top-coded", need to be estimated

	  - Capital gains, tax credits and liabilities predicted using a model

	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### The crosswalk
	  
	  Describe income in 4 ways:
	  
	  1. Market income (Piketty and Saez)

	  2. Add transfer payments (disability, unemployment, social security, etc)

	  3. Weight household size, add in kind transfers, add taxes

	  4. Add realized capital gains
	</section>

	<section>
	  <img src="img/armour_tab1.png" width=100%>
	</section>

	<section>
	  <img src="img/armour_tab2.png" width=64%>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Capital gains

	  - "Realized" capital gains are only observed when assets are sold

	  - Changes in wealth depend on the capital gains that are not "realized"

	  - If your portfolio goes up and you don't sell, your "income" has increased (at least in present value)
	</section>
	
	<section>
	  <img src="img/armour_tab3.png" width=100%>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Why is the difference so dramatic?

	  In 2007, compared to 1989, lower income people owned more:

	  - Equity

	  - Housing (!)

	  - Businesses
	  
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Housing since 2007

	  - Housing a primary source of capital "income"

	  - The 2007 recession resulted in a sharp decrease in housing

	  - This decrease was more severe among low-income home owners

	  - Housing shocks constrain ability to get credit, build wealth
	</section>

	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### What can we conclude?

	  - Non-market sources of income matter

	  - Recent inequality caused by labor income, top 1%

	  - Capital gains matter

	  - Unresolved: How has capital ownership changed since the last recession?
