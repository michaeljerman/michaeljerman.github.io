	  # Normative Theory

	  ## EC 399: Economics of Inequality

	  ## spring 2017
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Normative theory

	  - We have seen various ways to measure inequality and different properties of measures

	  - Indices can disagree with one another!

	  - Can we project our personal (or societal) values onto different distributions?

	  - When can we say that one distribution is *better* or *worse* than another?
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  Positive vs normative

	  - Much of economics can be broken down into *normative* vs *positive* analysis

	  - Positive claims can be verified, normative claims reflect values

	  - Positive claim: The Gini index for the US in 2016 was 45.0

	  - Normative claim: The Gini index for the US should be lower
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Normative theory

	  - Start with a set of values, then see what the implications of those values are

	  - Alternatively: Start with result, then see what kind of values we would need to have to make that result hold
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### A (very) brief overview of utility thoery

	  - Economists tend to think about value in terms of *utility*

	  - Utility is (roughly) our well-being, satisfaction, or happiness
	  
	  - Long history in philosophy, but very specific meaning in economics
	  
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Economic agents

	  - We assume people derive satisfaction from their ability to consume goods and service

	  - The more goods and services people are able to choose from, the better off they are

	  - Utility is the satisfaction that people get from the ability to choose

	  - Express utility as a number that allows us to rank different alternatives (higher utility means more satisfaction)
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Utility and income

	  - All else equal, more income allows us to buy more things

	  - Our utility increases as income increases

	  - **Diminishing marginal utility**: Our enjoyment of additional income get's lower as our income gets higher

	  - I'd be extremely happy if someone gave me \$100 --- Mark Zuckerberg probably wouldn't care very much
