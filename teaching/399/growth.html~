	  # Economic Growth

	  ## EC 399: Economics of Inequality

	  ## Spring 2017
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Global inequality

	  - Most international inequality is *between* country, not *within* country

	  - Some regions grow faster than others

	  - Different growth rates can increase global inequality

	  - "Rule of 70:" Small changes in growth rates can have large effects on income and inequality

	  ### Simple Solow

	  Aggregate production:

	  - Suppose output (GDP) is produced only with capital (machines)

	  - Assume labor is constant (no population growth, no unemployment)

	  - $Y = f(K)$

	  - $f'(K) < 0$: Diminishing marginal productivity of capital

	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Simple Solow, cont.

	  Capital law of motion:

	  - Capital depreciates at a constant rate $\delta$

	  - Machines wear out, need to be replaced periodically

	  - Everything we don't consume becomes capital

	  - Change in capital $= Y - C - \delta K$

	  - $\dot{K} = sf(K) - \delta K$
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Capital and growth

	  If $\dot{K}=0$:
	  - Capital is constant

	  - Producing just enough to replace depreciated capital
	  
	  - Then $Y=f(K)$ is constant $\rightarrow$ $Y$ is constant

	  If $\dot{K} > 0$:

	    - Capital is increasing

	    - $Y=f(K)$ is increasing $\rightarrow$ growth

	    Growing capital stock $\rightarrow$ growing income

	    		    (Picture)
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Steady state

	  - Diminishing marginal productivity of capital ensures that we always return to $\dot{K}=0$

	  - This is our *steady state* level of capital, $\bar{K}$

	  - If you start below steady state, capital and income decreases until you get to $\bar{K}$

	  - If you start above steady state, capital and income increase until you get to $\bar{K}$

	  - The further away from the steady state, the faster the convergence

	(Picture) 
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Poverty traps

	  - Suppose a country has access to two separate production technologies ("traditional" and "modern")

	  - The country must achieve a certain level of development before it can take advantage of modern technology

	  - The traditional steady state may prevent country from developing to the level necessary to use modern technology

	  (Picture)
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Convergence

	  - The steady-state level of capital is determined by the shape of the production function and the savings rate

	  - Countries with different production processes and different savings rates will have different steady-states

	  - This explains why we don't observe absolute convergence

	  (Picture)
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Adding steady-state growth

	  - In the simple model there is no growth in the steady state

	  - Data suggests that most countries have positive growth in the steady state

	  - We might think that our production process $f(K)$ gets better over time

	  - We can add an *exogenous* technology process $A$ that increases productivity

	  - $Y = Af(K)$
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Technological change

	  - Suppose $A$ grows at some constant rate $g$

	  - Then at the steady state, $Y$ is growing at the same rate

	  - $Y = Af(\bar{K})$

	  - $\bar{K}$ constant, $A$ grows at $g$, $\rightarrow$ $Y$ grows at rate $g$

	  - Capital accumulation happens as before
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Convergence

	  - If you start below $\bar{K}$, you will grow faster than $g$ until you get to the steady state

	  - If you start above $\bar{K}$, you will grow slower than $g$ until you get to the steady state

	  - Converge to a steady-state level of growth
