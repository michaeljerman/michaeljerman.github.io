<h2 id="orgb89cd86">The consumer's problem</h2>
<ul>
<li>Economic models have optimizing consumers</li>
<li>The "consumer's problem" is to maximize their lifetime utility:</li>

</ul>
<p>
\[\max_{\{c_t\}_{t=0}^T}~~ \sum_{t=0}^T \beta^t u(c_t)\]
</p>
<ul>
<li>Consumers can save, borrow, invest in skills, etc to maximize well-being</li>
<li>As \(T\rightarrow \infty\), agents will end up consuming the same amount each period regardless of initial state (\(t=0\))</li>

</ul>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-org480bcbd">
<h2 id="org480bcbd">Initial conditions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consumers with lower initial state will invest in assets, skills to increase future consumption</li>
<li>Initial state won't matter in the limit</li>

</ul>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-org363b449">
<h2 id="org363b449">Optimal consumption path</h2>
<ul>
<li>Each period (\(t\)), agents must decide how much to borrow (or save) and consume</li>
<li>When optimizing, this is determined by <i>Euler equation</i>:</li>

</ul>
<p>
\[u'(c_t) = (1+r)\beta u'(c_{t+1})\]
</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimizing agents <i>smooth</i> their consumption</li>
<li>Changes in (temporary) income will not affect consumption, simply save or borrow in response</li>

</ul>

<section id="slide-orgcfff2ae">
<h2 id="orgcfff2ae">Poverty and savings</h2>
<ul>
<li>Many people who live in poverty lack access to formal savings instruments (banks, stocks, etc)</li>
<li>Why is this the case? (Supply or demand?)</li>

</ul>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-orga243578">
<h2 id="orga243578">Savings behavior</h2>
<ul>
<li>We observe people living in poverty engaging in savings behavior</li>
<li>Use extra income to buy bricks, make home larger (value is stored in home)</li>
<li>ROSCA (rotating savings and credit associations)
<ul>
<li>Everyone puts money in a common pot every month</li>
<li>Each month one person (rotating) gets the entire pot</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Common for people to belong to multiple ROSCA, other credit groups</li>

</ul>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-org67729ff">
<h2 id="org67729ff">Supply side?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Banks incur fixed costs with each new bank account (paperwork, regulatory overhead, etc)</li>
<li>This is why many banks require minimum balances or charge a fee</li>
<li>Fees can be much higher than balances that poor would like to save (income &lt;$2/day)</li>

</ul>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-orgefd559f">
<h2 id="orgefd559f">Dupas and Robinson</h2>
<ul>
<li>RCT: Give rural Kenyans access to savings technologies (i.e. bank accounts)</li>
<li>Most women use the accounts, most men do not</li>
<li>Saving instrument allowed them to invest more in businesses, purchase more food for family</li>
<li>Few people used account after a year</li>
<li>Poor don't seem to take advantage of better savings opportunities when they become available!</li>

</ul>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-org0b37e57">
<h2 id="org0b37e57">Example</h2>
<ul>
<li>Banerjee and Duflo: Fruit vendors in Chennai, India borrow ~$50.00 each day for inventory, pay 4.69% interest <i>per day</i></li>
<li>Vendors also drink many cups of tea per day (~$0.10)</li>
<li>Drinking 2 fewer cups for three days would mean they are debt free in 90 days</li>
<li>Being debt-free would save them $2.00 per day</li>
<li>Why?</li>

</ul>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-org62d83e9">
<h2 id="org62d83e9">Example</h2>
<ul>
<li>Duflo, Kremer, and Robinson: Farmers in western Kenya can invest in fertilizer, greatly increasing yields (and therefore profit)</li>
<li>RCT: some farmers given fertilizer for free for a season, see yields increase</li>
<li>Next year, 90% go back to not using fertilizer!</li>
<li>Farmers report that they don't have enough savings when it becomes time to buy fertilizer again</li>

</ul>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-orgdc8cea4">
<h2 id="orgdc8cea4">Behavioral economics of saving and spending</h2>
<ul>
<li>People show <i>time inconsistency</i> in their behavior</li>
<li>Examples:
<ul>
<li>Pressing "snooze" too many times on the alarm</li>
<li>Asking someone to take a bag of chips away from you</li>
<li>Limiting the amount of cash you take out from the ATM</li>
<li>Casinos using chips instead of dollars (Disney dollars, gift cards, etc)</li>

</ul></li>

</ul>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-org428d70e">
<h2 id="org428d70e">Savings as a commitment device</h2>
<ul>
<li>Savings accounts allow you to bargain against your "future self"</li>
<li>Putting money in an account is like "taking away the bag of chips"</li>
<li>Offering people in poverty commitment devices (bank accounts that enforce self-imposed limits for withdraw or dates)  can increase savings considerably</li>
<li>Savings increase for people who are simply offered account, regardless if they use it!</li>
<li>With formal instruments, easy to take away the chips. Harder if you have to make the decision every day</li>

</ul>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-orgd8a837c">
<h2 id="orgd8a837c">Example</h2>
<ul>
<li>Duflo, Kremer, and Robinson: Kenyan farmers offered chance to buy fertilizer immediately after previous year's harvest</li>
<li>Now 50% of farmers use fertilizer the next year</li>
<li>Giving them the opportunity to buy in advance more effective than giving it to them for free!</li>

</ul>

<section id="slide-orgeb53c50">
<h2 id="orgeb53c50">Arrow-Debreu economies</h2>
<ul>
<li>In the Arrow-Debreu model, agents face risk and uncertainty</li>
<li><i>States</i> occur with certain probabilities</li>
<li>"Bad" states mean less income, "good" states mean more income</li>
<li>Uncertainty can be aggregate (macroeconomic) or idiosyncratic (only affects individuals)</li>

</ul>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-orgeb37902">
<h2 id="orgeb37902">State-contingent claims</h2>
<ul>
<li>Arrow-Debreu agents can trade <i>state-contingent claims</i> with one another
<ul>
<li>"If I get good state and you get a bad state, I agree to pay you if you do the same for me"</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Optimizing agents choose to fully insure against bad states (recall Euler equation)</li>
<li>Idiosyncratic risk does not affect agents, only affected by aggregate risk</li>

</ul>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-org7e66b7c">
<h2 id="org7e66b7c">Poor vs rich state-contingent claims</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rich people have many formal instruments to insure against idiosyncratic risk (unemployment insurance, health insurance, car insurance, savings accounts, social security, tax deductions, etc)</li>
<li>Poor are also very good at insuring against risk, but lack access to formal instruments</li>
<li>Risk-pools are smaller &#x2013; aggregate risk is greater</li>
<li>Farmers can't buy fertilizer because expenses "come up": neighbor gets sick, you help them out</li>
<li>Having money tied up in commitment device changes "on-hand" cash, changes "contracts" with family/neighbors</li>

</ul>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-org373d072">
<h2 id="org373d072">Policy</h2>
<ul>
<li>Formal credit opportunities make it less costly (economically and psychologically) to insure against idiosyncratic risk</li>
<li>Access to developed financial systems allows risk to be spread more broadly, diminishing aggregate risk
<ul>
<li>Bad harvests affect Kenyan farmers much more severely than Iowan farmers</li>

</ul></li>
