	  # Discrimination in Theory

	  ## ECON 383: Economics of Discrimination

	  ## Winter 2018
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Wage gaps

	  - We observe large wage gaps between many groups in the economy (gender, race, etc)
	  - Many possible explanations
	  - Today: Can employer prejudice explain wage gaps?
	  - We will investigate this *theoretically*
	</section>


	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Theoretical vs empirical analysis

	  - Broadly classify all economics research as *theoretical* or *empirical*
	  - Theory is *deductive*: start with a set of observations and assumptions, develop the logical implications of them (a model)
	  - Empirical analysis is *inductive*: describe the world and make predictions based on what is observed now or what has been observed in the past
	  - Theory can be *tested* with empirical analysis -- it can be "falsified" if empirical observations (data) contradict the theoretical model
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### What is a model?

	  - Theory is based on models
	  - A model is a simplification of reality
	  - A collection of assumptions and the logical implications of those assumptions
	  - The predictive or explanatory power of a model is only as good as the assumptions
	  - Using a model requires a tradeoff between tractability and realism (simpler models are easier to work with, less accurate)
	</section>
	
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Why theory?

	  1. Theory allows us to interpret empirical results (all empirical methods are based on *some* theory)
	  2. Analyze the implications of certain behaviors and beliefs
	  3. Predict how policy will affect society
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Economic theory

	  - Most economic theory is based on *optimization*
	  - Consumers are trying the *maximize* their well being
	  - Businesses are trying to *maximize* profits and *minimize* costs
	  - *Equilibrium* occurs when everyone is simultaneously achieving their (constrained) optimum (i.e. nobody wants to behave differently given their circumstances)
	  - Equilibrium is where the model "ends up" after time
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Terminology

	  - Individuals in the models are called *agents*
	  - Companies (businesses) are called *firms*
	  - Firms use *factors* (labor, capital) to produce *output* (goods and services)
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Production

	  - Firms produce output by employing factors in accordance with a *production function*
	  - The production function determines how much output can be produced with a given combination of factors
	  - For simplicity, assume one factor (labor)
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Diminishing MPL

	  - Each additional worker is called "marginal labor"
	  - The additional output that each new worker can produce (the marginal product) decreases as the number of workers increases (limited space, tools, etc)
	  - The *marginal product of labor* (MPL) decreases as labor increases
	</section>
	

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Profit maximization
	  
	  - Firms are profit maximizers
	  - Choose the amount of labor to employ that maximizes profits
	  - Firms employ labor until the value of the marginal product of labor is equal to the wage rate	  
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Profit max, cont

	  - Firm is deciding whether or not to hire an additional worker
	  - If they hire them, must pay a wage of $w$
	  - The worker can produce an additional MPL units of output
	  - Firm can sell that output and receive pMPL additional revenue
	  - When should the firm hire the worker?
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Profit max, cont

	  - Firm will hire the worker when $pMPL > w$
	  - If the additional revenue is greater than the additional costs, then profits will increase
	  - profits = revenue - cost
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Profit max, cont

	  - Now, firm is deciding whether or not to fire a worker (downsize)
	  - If they fire them, save $w$ in wages
	  - The worker can produce an additional MPL units of output
	  - Firm can sell that output and receive pMPL additional revenue
	  - When should the firm fire the worker?
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Profit max, cont

	  - Firm will fire the worker when $pMPL < w$
	  - If the additional revenue is less than the additional cost
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Profit max, cont

	  - The profit maximizing firm employs labor at the point where
	  $$ pMPL = w $$
	  - If $pMPL \neq w$, the firm could increase profits by changing labor, which means they are not profit maximizing!
	</section>
	

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Factor markets

	  - For now, assume the labor market is competitive
	  - Many workers (same productivities), large number of firms competing for those workers
	  - The decision of each individual firm does not affect labor market outcomes (wages and employment)
	  - Each firm takes the wage rate as given -- they can employ everyone they want at the market wage rate, but nobody will work for less than the market wage rate
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Profits and prejudice

	  - There's no room for prejudice if firms are profit maximizing!
	  - The productivity of workers is the only characteristic that matters for profits
	  - But different classes can have different productivities
	  - There can be discrimination without firm prejudice
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Becker model

	  - Gary Becker, *The Economics of Discrimination*, 1957
	  - Among the first economists to apply economic theory to "non-economic" situations (crime, family, etc)
	  - What if firms care about profits *and* worker characteristics (nepotism or prejudice)?
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Employer discrimination

	  - Suppose there are two classes of workers, A and B
	  - Workers have the same productivities
	  - Some firms dislike type B workers, would rather not hire them
	  - Becker: firms behave *as if* type B workers are more costly than their wage rate
	  - There is a dollar amount that captures the firm's distaste for B workers ("I'll only hire a B worker if they are \$5 cheaper than an A worker")
	  - Call this amount the *prejudice coefficient* (PC)
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Hiring decisions

	  Firms will employ only type B workers if:

	  $$ w_A > w_B + PC $$
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Hiring decisions, cont

	  Firms will hire only type A workers if:

	  $$ w_A < w_b + PC $$
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Unprejudiced firms

	  - If $PC = 0$, firms will simply hire the cheapest labor available
	  - If $w_B < w_A$, only type B workers will be hired
          - Firms will be segregated		      
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Prejudice and profits

	  - Firms with $PC>0$ will underemploy labor relative to the profit-maximizing level
	    - Prejudiced firms have lower profits than non-prejudiced firms
	    - In this model, *prejudice does not pay!*
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Competitive markets

	  - When markets are *competitive*, firms may enter and exit whenever they choose
	  - If there are positive profits, firms enter the market
	  - More firms = more supply, profits decrease
	  - Long-run (economic) profits are zero in competitive markets
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Discrimination in competitive markets

	  - Prejudiced firms have lower profits than non-prejudiced firms
	  - Competition induces non-prejudiced firms to enter industry (high profits)
	  - Profits of prejudiced firms decrease below zero
	  - Long run: prejudiced firms are driven out of the market
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Rent seeking

	  - Suppose prejudiced firms know that non-prejudiced firms will enter the market
	  - They have an incentive to make the market less competitive
	  - They can create *barriers to entry* and make *economic rents*
	  - Make it more costly for non-prejudiced firms to hire B workers
	  - Easier to do if politicians and policy makers also have prejudice!
