<h2 id="org8e8962d">Human capital</h2>
<ul>
<li>The skills that people can invest in that improve productivity are called <i>human capital</i></li>
<li>Job training, education, experience, etc</li>
<li>Human capital investments are the primary way people increase wages in the market (that's why we're all here!)</li>

</ul>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-org49a6677">
<h2 id="org49a6677">Labor market discrimination</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wage gaps shrink when controlling for "observables"</li>
<li>Black/white and Hispanic/white wage gaps shrinks ~20% when controlling for education</li>
<li>Differences in education (human capital) are the <i>primary</i> reason we see differences in labor market outcomes</li>

</ul>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-org9e68efe">
<h2 id="org9e68efe">Human capital acquisition in theory</h2>
<ul>
<li>Human capital is an investment</li>
<li>Agents will invest so long as return (in present value) is greater than cost</li>
<li>Homogeneous agents (all the same) will invest in the same amount of human capital, have the same wages in equilibrium</li>
<li>To generate differences, we need a <i>friction</i> that affects agents differently</li>

</ul>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-org64793e8">
<h2 id="org64793e8">Intergenerational human capital investments</h2>
<ul>
<li>In the "baseline" model, agents choose their own level of human capital</li>
<li>Real world human capital is determined by parents and environment</li>
<li>2nd graders don't have access to credit markets, can't change schools/buy better books etc</li>
<li>Parents face constraints (frictions): wages, debt, time, etc</li>

</ul>

</section>

<section>
<section id="slide-orgc82e9d2">
<h2 id="orgc82e9d2">Early childhood education</h2>
<ul>
<li>Education investments have substantial returns when children are very young (preschool)</li>
<li>Parental involvement (mothers) also affects later-life outcomes</li>
<li>Low income parents have less money to invest in preschool, less free time to spend with children</li>
<li>Significant gaps occur before children reach school</li>

</ul>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-org3aeeff5">
<h2 id="org3aeeff5">Concentrated poverty</h2>
<ul>
<li>Affluent communities have many resources available for parents and children (quality childcare/schools, financial institutions, low-crime, job connections, etc)</li>
<li>Poor communities often lack these things (geographic statistical discrimination)</li>
<li>Areas of <i>concentrated poverty</i> will lack opportunities for parents/children relative to areas of <i>concentrated privilege</i></li>
<li>Prejudice laws/restrictions segregate races into concentrated areas, frictions prevent people from moving out of concentrated poverty</li>

</ul>

<section id="slide-orgb8f0cf3">
<h2 id="orgb8f0cf3">Neighborhood effects</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ability to move up skill/wage ladder is highly correlated with neighborhood characteristics</li>
<li>Likelihood of making more money than your parents is much smaller when county is more segregated</li>
<li>Areas with higher fraction of black residents have less upward mobility</li>

</ul>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-org9336f38">
<h2 id="org9336f38">Causality</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do neighborhoods <i>cause</i> people to be less able?</li>
<li>Do less able people sort into neighborhoods?</li>
<li>To isolate effects of neighborhoods, need a source of exogenous variation (an "experiment")</li>
<li>Can't simply look at people who <i>choose</i> to move out of neighborhoods</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="orgcfe7f1b">Moving to Opportunity (MTO)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Program administered by Department of Housing and Urban Development</li>
<li>4,604 families enrolled in Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York</li>
<li>1994-1998</li>
<li>Families all have children and resided in public/project-based housing, high-poverty communities (&gt;40% poverty)</li>
<li>Predominantly black and Hispanic families</li>

</ul>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-org2eb67b1">
<h2 id="org2eb67b1">MTO Program</h2>
<ul>
<li>Families randomized into three groups:
<ol>
<li>Housing vouchers to move into private housing in low-poverty area (&lt;10% poverty)</li>
<li>Housing vouchers to move to any area (Section 8)</li>
<li>Control (no voucher)</li>

</ol></li>
<li>Random assignment \(\rightarrow\) causal estimates</li>

</ul>

<section id="slide-orgdea2237">
<h2 id="orgdea2237">Initial results</h2>
<ul>
<li>No average increase in wages/labor market outcomes after 5 years</li>
<li>Slight changes in mental health for first group</li>
<li>Boys were significantly worse off after moving than girls (more behavioral problems, etc)</li>

<h2 id="org9c38423"><a href="http://www.nber.org/mtopublic/final/MTO_IRS_2015.pdf">Chetty, Hendren, Katz (2015)</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><i>The Effects of Exposure to Better Neighborhoods on Children: New Evidence from the Moving to Opportunity Experiment</i></li>
<li>Authors hypothesized that effects of MTO should be strongest for younger children, who have more exposure to better neighborhoods</li>
<li>Link MTO participants to individual tax data many years later (MTO recorded SSNs)</li>

<h2 id="org6dbd982">Data</h2>
<ul>
<li>Tax data contains information on:
<ul>
<li>Earnings</li>
<li>College attendance</li>
<li>Marital status</li>
<li>Address</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Combine with other data on neighborhood characteristics, school quality, etc</li>

<h2 id="org6f7ae0f">Neighborhood exposure</h2>
<ul>
<li>Children who received the voucher were able to spend their childhoods in lower-poverty neighborhoods</li>
<li>Younger children spent a longer time in these neighborhoods</li>
<li>Authors speculate the neighborhood effects might be cumulative, longer time = more benefit</li>
<li>We would expect outcomes to be better for kids who received the vouchers early in life</li>

<ul>
<li>Children that received voucher had substantially higher incomes</li>
<li>Older children had <i>lower</i> incomes (moving in high school is hard)</li>
<li>Children of parents who used the voucher did even better, 31% increase in wages ($3,477)</li>

<li>What about the increase in behavioral problems among boys?</li>
<li>Effects are completely reversed by adulthood</li>
<li>Moving is difficult on children, but new communities might give more second chances/rehabilitation opportunities</li>
<li>Youth behavioral problems not cause poor outcomes in adulthood!</li>

<h2 id="orgdc753eb">Cost/benefit</h2>
<ul>
<li>Lifetime earnings of children increases $302,000 as a result of the program ($99,000 in present value)</li>
<li>This implies an additional tax revenue of $11,000 (PV)</li>
<li>Program costs $3,783 per family</li>

<li>Cost of living increases in better neighborhoods, making moving more costly</li>
