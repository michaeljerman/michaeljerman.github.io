	  # Why are Some Countries Poor?

	  ## ECON 383: Economics of Discrimination

	  ## Winter 2018
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  > "Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"

	  *Donald Trump, January 11, 2018*
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### The economics of "shitholes"

	  1. Why are some countries richer than others?
	  2. What are the economic consequences of allowing immigration from poor countries?

	  Today we'll talk about question 1.
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Growth economics

	  - *Economic growth* determines whether countries are rich or poor
	  - Growth is the change in (aggregate or average) income over time
	  - Rich countries aren't created rich, they grew into what they are
	  - Why were they able to grow? Why can't all countries grow?
	 
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### The rule of 72

	  - Growth rates are exponential, small changes can have significant consequences
	  - Suppose average income grows at a rate $g\%$ per year
	  - Income will double every $\frac{72}{g}$ years
	  Examples:
	  - US: $g=1.6$. Time to double: 45 years
	  - China: $g=6.7$. Time to double: 10.7 years
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Proximate causes

	  Many things are correlated with growth:
	  - Population growth
	  - Capital accumulation
	  - Human capital (education)
	  - Health
	  Do these things cause growth, or does growth cause them?
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Fundamental causes

	  The fundamentals determine the proximate causes:
	  - History
	  - Culture
	  - Geography
	  - Institutions
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson (AJR)

	  - The most important source of growth is institutions
	  - Douglass North: Institutions are "the humanly devised constraints that structure political and social interaction"
	  - The set of marketplace rules, enforcement, redistribution, etc that determine how economic agents interact
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Examples

	  - North and South Korea
	  - East and West Germany
	  - Nogales, Sonora and Nogales, Arizona
	</section>
	

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Measuring institutions

	  Protection from government expropriation:

	  > Government expropriation is not the only institutional feature that matters. Our view is that there is a "cluster of institutions," including constraints on government expropriation, independent judiciary, property rights enforcement, and institutions providing equal access to education and ensuring civil liberties, that are important to encourage investment and growth. Expropriation risk is related to all these institutional features.
	  
	  - How likely is it that the government will take your property?
	  
	</section>

	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Problem

	  - Institutions caused by growth?
	  - Richer countries may demand more accountable, fair government
	  - Need to find an "exogenous change" in institutions that allow us to measure effects
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### The theory

	  - Institutions are persistent. Historical institutions strongly predict current institutions
	  - European colonialists created institutions in the countries they colonized
	  - Some countries got "inclusive" institutions, others got "extractive" institutions
	  - Institutional structure determined by whether colonists wanted to settle a region (US) or extract resources and leave (Central and South America)
	  - Colonists wanted to stay in places where they didn't die (disease, hostile indigenous people, good soil, etc)
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Causality

	  - Early European settlers arrive in a location
	  - News of the conditions reaches their homeland
	  - **Hospitable place** = more settlers move
	  - Settlers create institutions that give political rights to citizens
	  - **Inhospitable place** = nobody moves
	  - Colonialists attempt to extract as many resources from the area as possible before going home
	  - Set up institutions that strongly favor elites, "exploit" non-elites
	</section>

	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Current institutions

	  - Largely determined by settler institutions
	  - Extractive colonialists = extractive institutions today
	  - "Inclusive" colonialists = inclusive institutions today
	  - Colonial institutions caused growth -- no other factors significant! 
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Reversal of fortunes

	  - Did colonists extract from countries that were already poor?
	  - No! Colonized countries that are poor today were generally more wealthy in 1500!

	  > "High population density, by providing a supply of labor that could be forced to work in agriculture or mining, made extractive institutions more profitable for the Europeans."

	</section>

	  <img src='img/ajr_r_figure1.png' height=625>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Reversal examples

	  Poor areas in 1500:
	  - US and Canada
	  - Australia and New Zealand

	  Rich areas in 1500
	  - Sub-Saharan Africa (Songhai Empire)
	  - Central and South America (Aztec, Inca)
	  - India (Mughal Empire)

	  Uncolonized Rich areas in 1500
	  - Western Europe
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Institutions and the reversal

	  - Rich to poor countries all have similarly extractive institutions today
	  - Poor to rich countries have similarly inclusive institutions today, same as countries with no reversal
