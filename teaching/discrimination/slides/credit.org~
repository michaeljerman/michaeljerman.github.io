* The consumer's problem
- Economic models have optimizing consumers
- The "consumer's problem" is to maximize their lifetime utility:
$$\max \sum_{t=0}^T u(c_t)$$
- Consumers can save, borrow, invest in skills, etc to maximize well being
- As $T\rightarrow \infty$, agents will end up consuming the same amount each period regardless of initial state ($t=0$)
