#+TITLE: Gender Prejudice
#+AUTHOR: ECON 383: Economics of Discrimination
#+DATE: Winter 2018

* Gender wage gap
- Much of the wage gap explained by observables 
  - Education, experience
- Much of residual gap explained by wage/hour nonlinearities
- Majority of wage gap not due to /labor market/ discrimination
- What about the remaining wage gap? Do we observe any prejudice in the labor markets?

* Estimating prejudice
- Audit studies: Applicants can't hide gender (on average)
- Employers may be responding to other signals 
  - Expectation of time off (statistical discrimination)
  - Same criticism with resume studies (i.e. Bertrand and Mullainathan)
- Ideal experiment: reveal gender /after/ hiring decisions made, see how hiring patterns change
  - Problem: Employers want to interview workers first, try to get more information productivity potential

* Orchestras 
- Orchestra musician productivity is primarily determined based on how well they perform
- Other skills much less important
- Most (all?) orchestras hire based on performance during auditions

* Goldin and Rouse (2000)
- /Orchestrating Impartiality: The Impact of "Blind" Auditions on Female Musicians/
- Prior to 1970s, orchestra auditions happen in front of musical director
- Many orchestras change at this time, put musicians behind a screen
  - Musical director can't see musicians, can only hear them
  - Carpets used to muffle footsteps
- Hiring decisions made "objectively," based on skill and interpretation rather than gender 


* Orchestra composition
- Orchestras have the same number of musicians
- Fixed proportions of instruments
  - Gender selection into instruments (i.e. harp, percussion) doesn't matter
- Gender composition must happen at the instrument level

* Anecdotal evidence of prejudice
- Zubin Mehta (LASO): "I just don't think women should be in an orchestra"
- Many European orchestras started adding women only recently
  - Vienna Philharmonic admitted first female in late 1990s

* Female LFP
- More women entering labor force during this time
- More female orchestra musicians to choose from
  - More likely to find a "high quality" female
- Blind auditions occurring at same time

*

* Identification
- Need screen to be the /only/ change
- Variation in timing of screen can't depend on LFP, changing attitudes within orchestra
- Identification threat: More women in orchestra $\rightarrow$ more likely to use blind audition

* Auditions
- Generally two or three rounds
1. Preliminary round
  - Determines "acceptable" candidates
  - Most common "blind" round
2. Semifinal
  - Not done at all orchestras
  - Sometimes blind
3. Final
  - Rarely blind

* The effects of blind auditions
- Musicians generally know beforehand if audition will be blind
- This may encourage different musicians to audition
- /Composition/ of applicants may change
- If more low-quality female musicians apply, will cause bias in estimates
- Solution: Compare audition results to the /same/ women who apply to orchestras with and without blind auditions
  - Controls for ability of each applicant

* Results
- Blind auditions increase a woman's chance of getting hired by 60%
- 30% of increase in aggregate female new-hires can be explained by blind auditions
- 25% of increase in total number of female musicians can be explained by blind auditions

* Identification threats
- Final rounds not blind, may still be unobserved bias 
- Comparing musicians across auditions assumes no change in average improvement between auditions for men and women
  - Women aren't getting better faster than men
  - Controlling for time between auditions doesn't change results
- Musicians who get hired at first audition are better than those who don't
  - Multiple-audition musicians different than single audition musicians
  - Very few musicians get hired any given year, unlikely a large bias
- Women may improve faster /and/ target orchestras with blind auditions for next round
  - Controlling for specific orchestras doesn't change results
- Men and women may play music differently, gender "observable" to directors
  - Difficult to control for, anecdotally not important

* External validity
- How well can apply results outside of the treatment environment?
- Our ability to extrapolate beyond the study group is called /external validity/
- How representative are orchestra musicians and musical directors of counterparts in other fields?
