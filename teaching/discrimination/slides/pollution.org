* Gender discrimination
- Residual wage gaps persist after controlling for observable characteristics
- Much of the residual gap can be explained by women's preferences (supply side)
- How might male preferences impact the gap? (demand side)
- What sort of preferences would "rationalize" demand-side prejudice?

* Men vs women in sports
- Kinesiology (study of human movement and performance): 
  - Top male athletes have advantages in short, quick speeds (sprint)
  - Top female athletes have advantages in longer, endurance-based activities (long-distance)
  - /Extremely/ simplified explanation!
- Differences not /necessarily/ due to biology
  - More men are exposed to sports, more resources used for training men, different cultural expectations, etc
- Male advantage is lesser in longer-distance events
  - Fastest 50m male swimmer is 12% faster than fastest woman
  - Fastest 1500m male swimmer is 9% faster than fastest woman
  - Many endurance records held by women

* Winter Olympics
- Men and women (usually) compete separately
- Many male events not offered to women
- Events not available to women tend to be /longer/, where men have /less/ of an advantage

* Examples
- Luge
  - Women's track: 1,201m
  - Men's track: 1,344m
- Unclear "natural" advantage for either gender
- Doubles luge is men only

* Cross-country
- Women's length: 10km
- Men's length: 15km

* Speed skating
- Women's longest distance: 10,000m
- Men's longest distance: 15,000m

* Ski jumping
- Women's event (normal hill):
  - One trial
  - Two scored jumps
- Men's event (normal hill)
  - Two training sessions
  - Qualification round
  - One trial
  - Two scored jumps
- Women's event (large hill)
  - Doesn't exist!
  - Women hold records at many facilities

* Alpine skiing
- Women's downhill: 
  - 2,710m with 730m drop
- Men's downhill
  - 2,857m with 825m drop

* Justifications
- Pierre de Coubertin (first IOC president, founder of modern Olympics): 
#+begin_quote
Women have but one task, that of the role of crowning the winner with garlands … in public competitions, women’s participation must be absolutely prohibited. It is indecent that spectators should be exposed to the risk of seeing the body of a women being smashed before their eyes.
#+end_quote

- Gian Franco Kasper (head of International Ski Federation): Ski jumping is not "appropriate for ladies from a medical point of view."

* Goldin (2014)
- /A Pollution Theory of Discrimination: Male and Female Differences in Occupations and Earnings/
- Some jobs have a level of "prestige" for men
- Women working in the job lowers the level of prestige for men
  - Prestige is "polluted" by women

* Skills and prestige
- Jobs require a minimum level of skill in a certain characteristic (intelligence, education, strength, etc)
- Society confers prestige by the minimum level needed to perform the job
  - Programmers have higher "prestige" than dishwashers
- Individual skills not observed, employers substitute averages (statistical discrimination)
- Technology changes can affect the minimum skill required, but they do /not/ affect the level of prestige

* Equilibrium
- Suppose men are the only workers in every field initially 
  - Initial prejudice
- When women enter market, only hired in jobs where the average female characteristic skill level is greater than the minimum level required
  - Prestige does not change, everyone knows (average) women can do the job when they are hired

* Technology changes
- Now suppose technology changes 
  - Women more productive, more educated, etc
- The average woman can succeed in more jobs (skills increase)
- /Prestige/ remains unchanged, as does /perception/ of women's skills
- Adding women to male fields suggests that the field is /less prestigious/ (requires lower skills), even if it is not

* Integration and segregation
- Model predicts that integrated jobs will be those that require low skill (below female median)
  - Prestige will not be affected
- Qualified women above the median will not find work in high-prestige jobs (perceptions of prestige will decrease)
- /Perceptions/ of skills determine prestige
  - If technology changes the minimum necessary skill to below the female median, job will remain segregated 

* Feedback loops
- Perceptions are a function of outcomes
- If women don't work certain jobs, can lead to the perception that they are incapable (regardless of actual skills)
- Example: Ski jump
  - Added to Olympics for women in 2014 after lawsuits
  - Lack of women contributes to perception that men are better at ski jump
  - Women competing with men would decrease the perceived difficulty of ski jumping 
  - Successful women "pollute" ski jumping for men
  - Men try to prevent qualified women from competing, fearing the perceived pollution
