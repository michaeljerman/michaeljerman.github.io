* Identification
Previously:
- Descriptive statistics vs causal estimates
- Quasiexperiments allow for robust estimates of causal effects
- Causal estimates require "identification assumptions"

* Estimating causal effects
- Suppose we think that variable $x$ causes variable $y$
- How do we estimate the causal effect?
- How do we interpret the causal estimate?
- We use /econometrics/ -- a set of statistical tools applied to economic problems
- Standard tool: Ordinary least squares (OLS) 
  - AKA: Linear regression

* OLS
- Suppose the /true/ (but unknown!) relationship between $x$ and $y$ is determined by:
$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + u_i$$
- $i$ is an index (person, state, country, etc)
- $\beta_0, ~\beta_1$ are /parameters/
- $e_i$ is the /error/
  - Random variation that occurs in nature
  - This error is zero on average

* OLS
$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + u_i$$
- Suppose $x_i$ increases by one unit. What happens to $y_i$?
  - $y_i$ increases by $\beta_1$
- $\beta_1$ is the /marginal/ effect of a change in $x$ on $y$

* Mean difference
- Suppose $x$ can take one of two values (ex: male/female)
- We call $x$ a /dummy variable/
  - $x_i = 1$ if individual $i$ is a female
  - $x_i = 0$ if individual $i$ is a male
- $y_i$ is the outcome variable (ex: wages)
  - Average wage for women: $\beta_0 + \beta_1$
  - Average wage for men: $\beta_0$
  - Difference between average woman and average man: $\beta_1$ (wage gap)
- $\beta_1$ is the /marginal/ difference between men and women

* Multiple regression
- Now suppose the true relationship is
$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \beta_2 z_i + e_i$$
- $y$ is determined by $x$ *and* $z$ 
- Now $\beta_1$ is the marginal effect of a change in $x$ /holding $z$ constant/
  - All else equal, how will a change in $x$ affect $y$?
- $z_i$ is a /control variable/

* Statistical inference 
- We never observe the "true model" (i.e. the "data generating process")
- We must /estimate/ the model parameters 
- Randomness ensures that are estimates are never perfectly accurate
- We can use statistics to assign a degree of confidence to our estimates

* P-values
- Given we have properly specified the model (identification assumptions), a p-value tells us how confident we are in an estimate
- P-value is the probability that we would see an estimate /at least as large/ as the one we observe if the /true/ marginal effect is zero
  - How likely is it that randomness is driving our results?
- Example: Estimate $\hat{\beta}_1 = 0.07$ with a p-value of $p=0.04$
  - If the true $\beta_1 = 0$, there's a 4% we would estimate $\hat{\beta_1} > 0.07$ due to randomness

* Statistical significance
- Research must choose a p-value that is "acceptable"
  - This is known as a "level of significance"
- In economics, this is generally $p<0.05$
- In particle physics, this $p<0.0000003$ ("5 sigma")

* Tables in economics papers
- Parameter estimates are usually reported in tables
- Ex:
$$0.4142$$
$$(0.002)$$
- The top number is $\hat{\beta}_1$
- The bottom number is the /standard error/
- If top/bottom > 1.96, then $p<0.05$
  - Usually (not always) use stars ($***$) to signify level of significance

* Uber
- "Car-sharing" service
- Drivers matched with riders based on an algorithm 
- Algorithm and riders do not observe gender of driver
- Driver pay also a function of the algorithm 
- Impossible for prejudice to exist in the Uber market!

* Wage gap
- Estimate the difference in earnings between men and women by estimating the equation:
$$\ln(Earnings_d) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 isMale_d + e_d$$
- $isMale_d$ is a dummy variable equal to one if driver $d$ is male
- Using log earnings means the parameter estimate is (approximately) a /percentage/ difference in pay

* Explaining the gap
- Not the Goldin "nonlinearity" story!
- What are female drivers doing differently that causes them to get lower wages?

* Residual gap
- Location and timing accounts for a small amount of the gap
- Remaining pay gap is 2.1% after controlling for all of this!

* Driver tenure
- Men are more likely to work for Uber for a longer period of time than women
- Men also drive more frequently than women
- Experience may increase wages

* Do men learn "faster" than women?
- Drivers are able to get higher wages by choosing types of rides to accept
- Drivers can strategically cancel certain rides to get higher wages
- Controlling for these effects does not change residual gap
  - Men aren't learning faster than women
