#+AUTHOR: ECON 383: Economics of Discrimination
#+DATE: Winter 2018

* Labor market outcomes
- How do gender and sexual orientation affect labor market outcomes (employment, wages, etc)?
- How are group perceptions formed? How might they change?
- Two recent papers:
  - /Gender, Sexual Orientation, and Behavioral Norms in the Labor Market/
  - /Do Laws Shape Attitudes? Evidence from Same-Sex Relationship Recognition Policies in Europe/

* Causality
- Why do men in same-sex couples earn/work less? Why do women in same-sex couples earn/work more? (Relative to opposite-sex couples)
- Demand side: Are employers discriminating/prejudiced?
- Supply side: Are the work decisions different on average for same-sex couples?

* Preferences vs perceptions
- Are people in same-sex relationships more likely to have "opposite gender" traits?
- Do employers /perceive/ people in same-sex relationships to have opposite gender traits?
- These questions likely not independent of each other (outcomes cause perceptions which cause outcomes)

* Experiment
- Send fictitious resumes to employers
- Manipulate sex, gender traits, sexual orientation
- Do employers have expectations about how women /should/ act with respect to gender traits? 
- Do employers have expectations about how LGBT applicants should act?
  - Are the gender expectations different for LGBT applicants?

* Manipulating gender traits
- Assign different words to "objective" portion of resume
- Male words:
#+begin_quote
aggressive, enterprising, assertive, bold, confident, self-starter, achiever, dynamic
#+end_quote
- Female words:
#+begin_quote
nurturing, caring, sympathetic, kind, supportive, encouraging, helpful, cooperative
#+end_quote

* Manipulating sexual orientation
- Randomize membership in various college groups
- LGBT groups:
#+begin_quote
For example, one non-LGBT activity was
labeled “Student Activities Board” and described how the applicant “planned and organized
events promoting diversity.”
#+end_quote

* Mechanical Turk
- Resumes evaluated on Mechanical Turk platform
- Participants told they were helping sort resumes for a real company
- Resumes scored based on predetermined characteristics

* Backlash effect
- Women experience negative reactions when they engage in "male" behavior
- In this case, are females punished for using "male" words in their resumes?

* Social attitudes
- Where do these attitudes about gender and sexual orientation come from?
- Can they change?
- Research question: How do changes in laws affect attitudes toward certain groups?

* Measuring attitudes
- European Social Surveys, 2002-2016
- Survey performed in 30 European countries
- Primary question of interest:
#+begin_quote
Do you believe that gay men and lesbians should be free to live their own life as they wish?
#+end_quote

* Policy changes
- Many countries are expanding rights for LGBT citizens
- This study: implementation of same-sex marriage or civil partnership laws
- Varies across countries, overall social attitudes not likely to affect years immediately before and after policy change

* Event study analysis
- Compare average attitudes before and after policy change
- Policy changes in "year 0"

* Placebo tests
- Identification threat: Countries that change policy are countries where social attitudes are changing
  - Sudden shifts in social attitudes might /cause/ policy changes
- LGBT attitudes likely to be related to attitudes toward other causes
  - Sudden shifts toward "liberal" causes, in general
- Changes in policy would therefore be similarly correlated with other large shifts
