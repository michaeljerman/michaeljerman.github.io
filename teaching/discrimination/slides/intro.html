	  <h2> ECON 383: The Economics of Discrimination </h2>

	  <h2> Winter 2018  </h2>

	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Reading

	  Lang chapter 10, sections 1 and 2 (pp 265-272)
	</section>
	

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### What is discrimination?

	  We often observe different outcomes for different groups. Why?
	  1. People may be prejudiced against certain groups
	  2. People may have incomplete information about groups
	  3. Different groups may have different opportunities
	  
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Discrimination vs prejudice

	  Discrimination:
	  - "Treating people differently on the basis of their membership in a class"

	  Prejudice:
	  - "Dislike, distaste, or misperception based on innate characteristics" 
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Example

	  - Two people apply for the same job. The applicants are identical in every way except one is a member of class "A" and the other is a member of class "B"
	  - The manager (class "A") chooses hires the class "A" applicant
	  - Is there discrimination? Prejudice?
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Example

	  - We observe that most firms in an industry hire type "A" workers over type "B" workers when both are available
	  - Is there discrimination? Prejudice?	  
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Example

	  - Type B workers are statistically more likely to quit their jobs after 1 year. Knowing this, firms prefer to hire type A workers.
	  - Is there discrimination? Prejudice?	  
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Uncovering discrimination

	  - It can often be very difficult to determine if discrimination (or prejudice) has occurred
	  - Sometimes the same outcomes can be created by different behaviors and attitudes
	  
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Segregation

	  - People may *sort* into different neighborhoods, jobs
	  - Type A people may live and work near other type A people
	  - Possible (but not likely) to have segregation without discrimination
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Discrimination and prejudice in economics

	  - The discipline of economics has a long and complicated relationship with discrimination and prejudice
	  - Foundations in moral philosophy classical liberalism ("all **men** are created equal")
	  - White men are overly represented in the field

	  ### The "Dismal Science"

	  Thomas Carlyle, 1849:

	  > Not a 'gay science', I should say, like some we have heard of; no, a dreary, desolate and, indeed, quite abject and distressing one; what we might call, by way of eminence, the dismal science...[economists] find the secret of this Universe in 'supply and demand', and reducing the duty of human governors to that of letting men alone

	  - Unlike economists of the time, Carlyle believed "idle Black man in the West Indies [should be] compelled to work as he was fit, and to do the Maker's will who had constructed him"
	  
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### American Economic Association, 1896

	  > There lie at the root of all social difficulties or problems, racial traits and tendencies which make for good or ill in the fate of nations as well as of individuals. 
	</section>
	

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Economics today

	  Noah Smith, 2014, [*Economics is a Dismal Science for Women*](http://affectfinance.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Economics-Is-a-Dismal-Science-for-Women-Bloomberg-View.pdf):

	  > It's time for economics to acknowledge that it has a sexism problem and to fix it. The American Economic Association, and other powers that be within the profession, need to start working to make the field more welcoming to women

	  
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### [Wu, 2017](http://affectfinance.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Economics-Is-a-Dismal-Science-for-Women-Bloomberg-View.pdf)

	  - Analyzed posts from an internet forum popular with economists
	  - Used machine learning tools to classify posts as "male" or "female" based on the subject of the comment
	  - Rank the words that are most commonly associated with comments about men and comments about women

	  ### George Borjas, Harvard:

	  > I personally find the forum refreshing. Thereâ€™s still hope for mankind when many of the posts written by a bunch of over-educated young social scientists illustrate a throwing off of the shackles of political correctness and reflect mundane concerns that more normal human beings share: prestige, sex, money, landing a job, sex, professional misconduct, gossip, sex, and putting down "reg monkeys," a subspecies of economists that cares little about conceptual issues and lives simply to run regressions.

	  ### This class

	  - We will use the tools and methods of economics to uncover the existence, causes, and consequences of discrimination
	  - We must acknowledge that some of the tools and methods were developed by deeply flawed individuals
	  - We will pay careful attention to the *assumptions* and *limitations* of the our methods
	  - It is important that we do not draw conclusions that are not supported by the data
