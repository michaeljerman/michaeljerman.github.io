#+TITLE: Gender Attitudes
#+AUTHOR: ECON 383: Economics of Discrimination

* /Does Integration Change Gender Attitudes?/
- Dahl, Kotsdam, Rooth (2018)
- New, unpublished research

* Labor market segregation
- Many jobs are primarily male or female
- Similar in education
- Why do women and men work in different jobs?
  - Is it a choice?
  - Do expectations matter?
  - Do attitudes matter?

* Attitude
- Existing attitudes toward gender discourage women from entering some fields
- Can attitudes be changed?
- Does exposure to women in the workplace change attitudes?
- Identification problem: "Better" attitude workplaces tend to hire more women

* The experiment
- Randomly assign women to certain groups of male workers
- Ask workers about attitudes toward women before and after assignment
- Dahl et al use Norwegian military squads

* Norwegian military service
- Conscripted military
- All 17 year old men and women screened for military service
- ~13% selected for military service (most motivated)
- 8 weeks of boot camp
- Mandatory for men if selected, optional for women (since changed)
- Self-selection: Most motivated men and women end up serving (like other jobs)

* Experimental design
- Recruits separated in to squads
  - Train together for 8 weeks
  - Share room, meals, etc
- Give survey to each incoming recruit
- Randomly assign women to squads
- Re-administer survey after boot camp

* Survey questions
- "Teams perform better when made up of the same sex."
  - 1: Completely disagree, 7: Completely agree
- "It is important for men and women to share household work equally."
  - Strongly agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, etc
- "I am feminine."
  - Does not fit at all, does not fit well, reasonable fit, etc
- Each question coded as binary variable (zero or one)

* Identification assumption
- Only thing that is different across groups is exposure to women
- Randomization assures this is true /on average/
- Common to report "treatment arms" to see if treated and untreated groups are similar
  - Might get differences from a "bad draw," might threaten results

* Robustness
- All causal estimates depend on identification assumptions
- These assumptions can't be tested!
- Instead, common to use "robustness checks" and "placebo tests"
- Does the result hold up to various specifications/assumptions?
- Does the statistical model imply nonsensical results?

* External validity
- How well do we expect these results to hold outside of the experimental environment?
- Are the people being studied systematically different than general population or other segregated jobs?
- Can't test directly, but we can compare attitudes across groups
