#+TITLE: Transgender Outcomes
#+AUTHOR: ECON 383: Economics of Discrimination
#+DATE: Winter 2018

* Causal effects of gender
- Difficult to establish causality with respect to gender outcomes
- Can't experimentally alter gender
  - Resumes can be altered, don't tell the whole story
- Ideal experiment: Change gender of workers, compare outcomes before and after

* Transgender people in the labor market
- People who transition from one gender to another seem to fit this criteria
- We can observe differences in pay before and after transition
- Can we attribute these differences to gender discrimination?
- How close is this to our "ideal" experiment?

* Schilt and Wiswall (2016)
- /Before and After: Gender Transitions, Human Capital, and Workplace Experiences/
- Use survey data to analyze labor market outcomes before and after transitioning

* Data
- Voluntary survey conducted at three conferences (Transunity, A Gender Odyssey, International Foundation of Gender Expression)
- Survey posted online at /transacademics.org/
- 64 survey respondents
- Questions on earnings before transitioning, immediately after, and current job

* Wage differences
- Transgender women see a decrease in earnings after transitioning
- Authors speculate that this may impact timing of transition 
- Timing observed in survey

* Identification assumptions
- Data is representative of population
- Transition decision independent of other labor market outcomes
- Male transgender individuals similar to female transgender individuals (identifying differences)
- Average transgender male has finite (and fairly small!) willingness-to-pay for transitioning

* Sample
- Respondents at a conference, engaged in the "community"
- By definition, not representative of average transgender person
- Experiences and background determine community involvement and labor market outcomes

* Identification
- Causal effect of transitioning on labor market outcomes requires no other contemporaneous changes that affect work
- A major life event, likely to change many facets of a person's life
- Social influences important: if society treats transgender men and transgender women differently from each other, then expect experiences to diverge from cisgender men and women
  - Example: If transgender women face more hostility than transgender men, would expect wages to decrease independently of "pure" gender effects

* Identification
- Transgender men earn 10-12% less after transitioning 
- Transition 9 years later
- Implies a willingness to pay of $64,000 over 10 years (undiscounted)
- Not very high! 
- Unlikely to be caused by labor market considerations exclusively

* Limits of economic methodology
- Economists obtain causal estimates from well-identified problems using representative data
- /None/ of these things are present in the current context!
- Economic outcomes of transgender people may be beyond economic methodology
- Other forms of knowledge more valuable in these settings
- People who have actually lived (outwardly) as "both" genders have unique perspectives on gender differences that can't be observed empirically

* Experiential knowledge
#+begin_quote
How did they know when other people started seeing them as men? Aside from being addressed as “sir,” they were treated in “strikingly different” ways, they told her.

“For one person, it was like, suddenly he knew how to use electronics and set up computers,” Abelson says. Their experiences varied, but for many interviewees, it was a “night and day change.”

* Heterogeneity and intersectionality
- Small sample sizes mean low statistical power
- Impossible to estimate causal differences on subsamples (too few observations)
- Outcomes for transgender people vary greatly based on other characteristics
