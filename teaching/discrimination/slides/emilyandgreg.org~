#+TITLE: Do Firms Discriminate?
#+AUTHOR: ECON 383: Economics of Discrimination
#+DATE: Winter 2018

* Becker model
- Prejudiced firms earn less profits than non-prejudiced firms
- Competition decreases discrimination
- Segregated firms in the long run
- What do we observe in the real world?
- Bertrand and Mullainathan
* Reading an economics journal article
- A "thorough" reading of a published research article can take many hours (or even days)
- With time constraints, we need a strategy to get the main ideas in less time
- Practice!
- Develop a plan/checklist
* Strategy
- Read the abstract carefully. This is the information the authors think is most important for the reader to know.
- Read the introduction
- Skip to the conclusion (or read this first)
- Look at every table/figure, try to understand its purpose (may have to refer to main text -- Ctrl-F can be your friend!)
* Questions to answer
Every time you pick up a (empirical) journal article, you should be able to answer the following questions:
1. What is the main research question? (/Question/)
2. Why is this question important? (/Motivation/)
3. How do the authors attempt to answer the question? (/Methods/)
4. What are the main results? (/Results/)
5. What are the caveats/limitations of the main results? (/Policy implications/)
* 1. Research question
- Should be established in the abstract/introduction
- Often very simple and straight-forward, sometimes very arcane and obscure (we won't be reading many of these papers)
* 2. Why is this paper important?
- This is the /motivation/ of the research
- What do we know about this research question already?
- What do we /not/ know?
- How will knowing the answer to this question improve our theoretical knowledge/policy?
- Usually in the introduction or "literature review"/"background"
- Sometimes this seems obvious -- that's a good thing!
* 3. Methodology
- What kind of data? (Survey, observational, cross-sectional, panel, experiment, etc)
- What is the /identification strategy/?
  - How do the authors use the data to answer the question?
- What are the identification assumptions?
- Usually described in the abstract/introduction, details in the main text somewhere
- Expect to spend the most time on this part
* 4. Results
-
