	  ### Background

	  - India's rivers are heavily utilized and dangerously polluted

	  - 14,780 sewage treatment plants (STPs) in the United States, 234 in India

	  - Nearly 1 trillion USD has been spent by the government of India to combat pollution levels, widely believed to be ineffective

	  - No systematic study of the effectiveness of any specific policy intervention at the national level
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Overview

	  - Estimate the effects of a specific policy intervention (the construction of new STPs in 1995)

	  - Develop a novel econometric model to account for downstream pollution and treatment spillovers

	  - Failing to account for downstream effects can significantly bias estimated treatment effects

	  - Propose a methodology to analyze the political economy of STP placement and operational effectiveness 
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Previous literature

	  - Greenstone and Hanna (2014): Find no pollution reduction on Indian river segments designated as "problem areas" by the government using a simple difference-in-differences approach

	  - Lipscomb and Mobarak (2015): Estimate downstream spillovers in Brazil using exogenous shifts in administrative boundaries
	  
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Data

	  River monitoring stations:

	  - 447 stations across India

	  - Located along 60 river systems

	  - Monthly observations of fecal coliform bacteria (fcoli) from 1986 to 2004 (many missing observations)

	  Sewage treatment plants (STPs)

	  - Ministry of Environment and Forests periodically attempts to collect information on the known universe of STPs

	  - 107 were build in 1995 as part of the National River Conservation Plan (NRCP)

	  ### Treatment externalities

	  - 447 monitoring stations along 60 river systems
	  
	  - Each river system has 7.45 monitoring stations on average

	  - 28 river systems have one monitoring station

	  - The Ganga system has 109 stations

	  - A single STP is likely to decrease measured pollution at multiple stations, biasing the diff-in-diff

	  ### Downstream effects

	  - Pollution levels measured at each monitoring station are a function of upstream pollution levels

	  - Shocks and treatment persist downstream, contaminating observations at each downstream station

	  - Biases treatment effect estimates and standard errors

	  - I account for this with a spatial model, where pollution observations are allowed to be functions of upstream pollution observations
	</section>
	
	<section>
	  <h3> Spatial model </h3>
	  <img src='img/eqspat.png' width=40%>

	  <ul>
	    <li> W and M are spatial weight matrices which describe the spatial spillovers </li>
	  </ul>
	  
	</section>

	<section>
	  <h3> Spatial weights </h3>
	  <img src='img/eqweights1.png' width=75%>

	  <ul>
	    <li>  $\rho$: Captures the rate of pollution decay through introduction of cleaner water into the system or natural organic processes</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	</section>

	  <h3> Solving the spatial model </h3>
	  <img src='img/eqspatsolved.png' width=75%>

	  <img src='img/eqspatsum.png' width=58%>

	  <ul>
	    <li>  Each entry of the matrix $W(\rho)^k$ gives the exponential of distance between an STP and the monitoring station k stations downstream </li>
	    <li> The infinite sum therefore captures the total downstream effects of an STP on all downstream stations </li>
	    <li> This result obtains from the novel exponential specification of the spatial weights matrix </li>
	    <li> The error term is similarly a function of upstream errors </li>
	  </ul>
	  
	</section>

	    ### Estimating the spatial model

	    - There are 1,124 parameters to be estimated

	    - MLE computationally inefficient, unlikely to converge, with unreliable Hessian estimates

	    - Estimated instead as a Bayesian model with uniform priors (No-U-Turn sampler)

	    ##### (More)
	  </section>

	  <section data-markdown>
	    ### Priors

	    - $\rho$, $\lambda$: Exponential(1). Likelihood function is approximately uniform for large values.

	    - Fixed effects: Uniform

	    - Treatment effects: Uniform

	  ### Health benefits

	  - Increasing fcoli by 2.3 doubles the likelihood of contracting a gastrointestinal illness

	  - Estimated treatment effect will reduce this likelihood by 15% immediately downstream of a STP

	  - Maha Kumbh festival attracts 120 million attendees, most of whom bath in the Ganga

	  - An operational STP immediately upstream of the festival would eliminate approximately 600,000 cases of gastrointestinal disease
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Accounting for the decrease in effectiveness

	  - Government officials inspected 84 of 236 known STPs in 2007

	  - 55% were rated as being in "poor" or "very poor" working condition

	  - Many stations were entirely abandoned and overgrown with vegetation
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Ongoing research

	  - Use remotely-sensed luminosity, population, and watershed data to predict pollution levels along all river stretches with the spatial model described above

	  - Estimate optimal placement of STPs, compare to actual placement

	  - Investigate the political economy of STP placement and ongoing operation (elections of 1996)
