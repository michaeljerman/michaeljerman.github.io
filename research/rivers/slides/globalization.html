	  # Globalization

	  ## EC 399: Economics of Inequality

	  ## Spring 2017
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### International trade

	  - *Law of comparative advantage*: Nations benefit from trade by specializing in production of goods with lowest relative costs

	  - Comparative advantages always exist (by definition), so nations always benefit from trade (in the aggregate)

	  - Gains and losses from trade are unevenly distributed, may impact inequality

	  - Middle-skill jobs may have been outsourced, contributing to labor-market polarization
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Stolper-Samuelson theorem

	  - As the price of a good rises in international markets, the returns to the factor used most intensively in the production of that good will increase

	  - Labor market in America has become polarized, largely low-skill and high-skill labor

	  - Price increase in low-skill products with decrease inequality, price increase in high-skill products will increase inequality
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Example

	  - Suppose a low-income country enters the global market and exports goods

	  - Comparative advantage in low-skill workers means they export low-skill products

	  - Increase in supply decreases global price

	  - Returns to low-skill workers in the US declines (Stolper-Samuelson)

	  - Returns to low-skill workers in low income countries increases
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Empirical evidence

	  - Trade liberalization has contributed to rise in skill premium in the US

	  - Effects are generally small, most of the rise comes from somewhere else

	  - Theory does *not* hold in developing countries, which have also seen increased wage polarization

	  - SBTC seems to do a better job of explaining broad patterns
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Trade costs and technology

	  - Skilled workers are more productive because they are better able to use sophisticated technology

	  - Much of this technology (computers) is imported from overseas

	  - Cheaper imports allow firms to buy more computers, makes skilled workers more productive

	  - Contributes to increase in skill-premium

	  - This impacts all countries similarly

	  - Cheap technology and SBTC overwhelm the Stolper-Samuelson effects
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Winners and losers

	  - Trade and globalization have small effects on inequality

	  - Generally, everyone is made better off by trade (some more so than others)

	  - Who are the losers from trade? How do they lose?
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### The China Shock

	  - Historically, imports from low-wage countries have been small

	  - Since 2000, low-income share of imports has doubled, almost entirely due to increased imports from China

	  - Many of the imports require "routine" labor (manufacturing, for instance)
	</section>

	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Autor, Dorn, Hanson (2013)

	  - For each "commuting zone" in the US, compute the "trade exposure," --- the percentage of local industries that produce goods that are also exported by China

	  - Compare the outcomes in these zones before and after Chinese imports increased (2001, when China joins WTO)

	  - Does trade exposure explain differences in employment, wages, etc?
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Effects of China shock

	  - Increased Chinese imports does not affect migration out of exposed areas (recall "Moving to Opportunity" and the Icelandic volcano)

	  - China shock has significant and large effects on unemployment in exposed areas

	  - Unemployment effects larger for non-college educated workers

	  - Unemployed manufacturing workers shift into other industries, decreasing wages for others in the area
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Mobility and labor shocks

	  - We saw that moving can have large benefits for workers, but mostly for younger people and their children

	  - But even when jobs disappear, people don't move very frequently

	  - Negative shocks can be long-lasting

	  - Low intergenerational mobility means these shocks can persist for decades

	  - Policy?
