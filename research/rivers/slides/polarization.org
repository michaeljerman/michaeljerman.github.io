#+TITLE: Labor Market Polarization 
#+AUTHOR: ECON 499: Economics of Inquality
#+DATE: Winter 2018 

* So far:
- Top incomes have diverged rapidly since the 1980s
  - True in the cross section and life-cycle (for men and women)
  - Top incomes largely determined by market forces ("talent")
  - How do people acquire talents?
  - Why are "talents" more valued today than in the past?
* Changes in inequality
- Measure inequality with the 90/10 quantile ratio
- Since top 10% income share increasing (Piketty and Saez), expect 90/10 ratio to grow
- Similar to quantile ratio, compare relative wages of college educated vs non college educated

* Skilled workers
- The supply of skilled workers has been increasing steadily
- 10% of workforce had college education in 1960
- 30% in 2005
- We would expect wages for skilled workers to decline

* The skill premium
- The skill premium is the "reward" to education in the form of increased wages
- The wage premium has been increasing steadily
- Supply also increasing
- This means demand for skilled labor must be increasing at a faster rate
* Why Are There Still So Many Jobs? (Autor, 2015)
- Technology and "automation" have increased rapidly, yet unemployment doesn't seem to have changed
- Why hasn't automation created unemployment?
- What are the implications of this technological change?

* Automation
- Technology replacing jobs is not a new phenomenon
- Many agricultural jobs have been automated
- 41% of all workers in 1900, 2% today

* Complements and substitutes
Complements:
- Factors that are used together in the production process
- Example: Programmers and computers
Substitutes:
- Factors that can replace one another
- Example: Farm worker, combine harvester
* Technology as a complement
- Some tasks are complemented by technological innovation
- Faster computers make programmers (and economists!) more productive
- ATMs allow bank tellers to do other work, e.g. customer service, sales, etc
- Workers have historically moved to technology-complementary industries as jobs are automated
- Increase in technology-complementary jobs offsets losses in substituted jobs
*

* Jobs that aren't substituted by technology
1. "Abstract" jobs: Problem solving, intuition, creativity. Professional, technical, managerial jobs.
2. "Manual" jobs: Adaptability, language recognition, human interaction. Food prep, service, healthcare jobs.
* Skills and jobs
- Abstract jobs usually require training and education
- Manual jobs can be learned "on the job", not as much education needed
- Jobs in the middle of the skill distribution are "hollowed out"
*

* Technology complements
- Not all jobs benefit the same from technology
- Computer programmers might benefit more from faster computers than bank tellers from ATMs
- Differences in productivities will be reflected in wages
- Which workers are complemented by technological innovations?
* Skill-biased technological change (SBTC)
- Technological advances have complemented high-skilled workers more than low-skilled workers
- Computers allow doctors to diagnose better, lawyers to find laws better, financial analysts to model asset prices better, etc
- We say that technological change has been *biased* toward skilled workers
- Skilled workers receive more benefits from technology than other workers
*

* Middle-skill jobs
Break up "abstract" and "manual" jobs into routine and nonroutine categories:
1. Nonroutine abstract: Management and professionals
2. Nonroutine manual: Service, care providers
3. Routine abstract: Sales, support, office
4. Routine manual: Construction, manufacturing, mining

* Trade and polarization
- Routine jobs are easily outsourced as well as easily automated
- Educated workers oversees compete against domestic workers for routine jobs
- Growth of India and China has greatly increased the supply of foreign workers who can perform routine jobs
* Global vs local inequality
- The rise of China and India has vastly reduced global income inequality
- With growth comes new workers that can compete in global market
- This hollows out middle skill, routine tasks
- Makes inequality increase in developed countries
* Returns to education
- If returns to education are so high, why doesn't everyone get advanced degrees?
- Returns to education high enough to make student debt "worth it"

* Credit constraints
- High-income students might have better access to credit markets
- More students are dependent on private student loans in addition to Government loans
- Private loans are often not available to low-income students
* Increasing value of leisure time (speculative)
- "The Free-Time Paradox in America", Atlantic Magazine, September 2016 
- Low skill, young men work much less today than in the past
- 3/4 of additional leisure time is spent playing video games
- "Life satisfaction" surveys indicate they are just as happy
* Consumer surplus and leisure
- Entertainment goods are much cheaper today than in the past
- People are willing to pay high amounts for entertainment, but prices are low
- Internet based goods are very low cost (Wikipedia, Netflix, Facebook)
- The same level of income can buy more utility (satisfaction)
- Some people might be less willing to work hard to become rich (marginal utility of income is lower)
* Summary
- Automation and trade replace jobs that require some skill
- High skill and low skill jobs not replaced by automation or trade
- Technology is "biased" toward high-skilled jobs, increasing wages
- High skilled and low skilled workers are pulled apart
- Some low skilled workers might be content to not acquire skills (speculative!)
