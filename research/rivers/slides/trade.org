#+TITLE: Trade and Globalization
#+AUTHOR: ECON 499: Economics of Inequality
#+DATE: Winter 2018

* International trade
- *Law of comparative advantage*: Nations benefit from trade by specializing in production of goods with lowest relative costs
- Comparative advantages always exist (by definition), so nations always benefit from trade (in the aggregate)
- Gains and losses from trade are unevenly distributed, may impact inequality
- Middle-skill jobs may have been outsourced, contributing to labor-market polarization

* Stolper-Samuelson theorem
- As the price of a good rises in international markets, the returns to the factor used most intensively in the production of that good will increase
- Labor market in America has become polarized, largely low-skill and high-skill labor
- Price increase in low-skill products with decrease inequality, price increase in high-skill products will increase inequality

* Example
- Suppose a low-income country enters the global market and exports goods
- Abundance of low-skill workers means they export low-skill products
- Increase in supply $\rightarrow$ decrease in global price
- Returns to low-skill workers in the US declines (Stolper-Samuelson)
- Returns to low-skill workers in low income countries increases

* Empirical evidence
- Trade liberalization has contributed to rise in skill premium in the US
- Effects are generally small, most of the rise comes from somewhere else
- Theory does *not* hold in developing countries, which have also seen increased wage polarization
- SBTC seems to do a better job of explaining broad patterns

* Trade costs and technology
- Skilled workers are more productive because they are better able to use sophisticated technology
- Much of this technology (computers) is imported from overseas
- Cheaper imports allow firms to buy more computers, makes skilled workers more productive
- Contributes to increase in skill-premium
- This impacts all countries similarly
- Cheap technology and SBTC overwhelm the Stolper-Samuelson effects

* Winners and losers
- Trade and globalization have small effects on inequality
- Generally, everyone is made better off by trade (some more so than others)
- Who are the losers from trade? How do they lose?

* The China Shock
- Historically, imports from low-wage countries have been small
- Since 2000, low-income share of imports has doubled, almost entirely due to increased imports from China
- Many of the imports require "routine" labor (manufacturing, for instance)

- For each "commuting zone" in the US, compute the "trade exposure," -- the percentage of local industries that produce goods that are also exported by China
- Compare the outcomes in these zones before and after Chinese imports increased (2001, when China joins WTO)
- Does trade exposure explain differences in employment, wages, etc?

* Effects of China shock
- Increased Chinese imports does not affect migration out of exposed areas (recall "Moving to Opportunity" and the Icelandic volcano)
- China shock has significant and large effects on unemployment in exposed areas
- Unemployment effects larger for non-college educated workers
- Unemployed manufacturing workers shift into other industries, decreasing wages for others in the area

* Mobility and labor shocks
- We saw that moving can have large benefits for workers, but mostly for younger people and their children
- But even when jobs disappear, people don't move very frequently
- Negative shocks can be long-lasting
- Low intergenerational mobility means these shocks can persist for decades
- Policy?
