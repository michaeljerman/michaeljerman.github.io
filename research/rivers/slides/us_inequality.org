#+TITLE: Inequality in the United States
#+AUTHOR: ECON 499: Economics of Inequality
#+DATE: Winter 2018

* What is inequality?
- We know how to think about inequality theoretically
- How do we measure inequality?
- What can the data tell us?

* Kuznets hypothesis
- Poor countries have homogeneous labor, mostly agriculture
- As countries develop, cities become industrial centers
- Creates urban/rural wage gap, increasing inequality
- As development increases, rural workers become educated and move to cities
- Reduces supply of rural workers, increases wages, decreases inequality

- "Income inequality in the United States, 1913-1998"
- One of the first papers to estimate long-run evolution of inequality
- Two of the most prominent empirical researchers
- Renewed economists interest in inequality
- Much of these findings are included in Piketty's famous book (which we will talk about later)
* Data

- Tax return statistics reported by IRS
- Most people did not pay income tax prior to 1944, so focus on top 10%
- Gross income: Wages, profits, dividends, interest, rents, etc
- Exclude capital gains (people don't sell assets every year, therefore it is "lumpy")
- Calculated before any taxes, deductions, or transfers

* The fall in top income share
- 1938-1939
- World War II funded primarily through corporate income tax
- Top incomes were mostly earned through capital income

* Declining capital incomes
- Capital incomes for the top income earners have declined steadily since WWII
- Capital income is derived from wealth
- After WWII ended, why did capital incomes not recover to previous levels?
- Why are the wealthy not earning as much capital income today?
  
* Progressive taxation: A possible explanation
- Pre WWI taxes are relatively flat, allowed wealth to accumulate
- Great depression and WWII "shocks" decreased the wealth of the top earners
- Progressive taxation and corporate taxes prevented wealth from accumulating to previous levels
* The rise in top income after 1970
- Primarily labor income
- Tax Reform Act of 1986: Top marginal tax rate changed from 50% to 28%
- Raised to 39.6% by 1993
- Initial cut coincides with rapid growth of top incomes

* A mystery?
- It's not clear from the data what is causing the rapid rise in top incomes
- Piketty and Saez speculate that changing social attitudes toward executive pay may be a factor

* Critiques of Piketty and Saez
- Only looking at income in the top 10%, ignoring inequality elsewhere in the distribution ("transfer sensitivity" principle)
- The unit of observation is the "tax unit", not weighting observations by number of people, children, etc
- Their definition of income ignores non-market sources
* What is income?
- Piketty and Saez:
  - Salaries and wages
  - Capital gains
- Other sources:
  - Benefits
  - Taxes
  - "In kind" transfers
* Market vs comprehensive income
- Market income:
  - The pre-tax compensation earned in exchange for selling labor
  - Income from capital: profits, interest, etc
- Comprehensive income:
  - Market income plus "everything else"
  - The total money received that can be used to purchase goods and services
* Healthcare
- A large non-market source of income
- People need to consume health services whether or not they have insurance
- Employer-provided insurance isn't included in wages, by allows people to consume more than they otherwise could
* Healthcare facts
- Healthcare expenses were 17% of GDP in 2014
- 70% of expenses paid by public or private insurance (not out-of-pocket)
- 36% of all expenses paid by Federal programs Medicaid and Medicare
- Average Medicaid recipient receives $9,125 per year (family of 3)
* Medicare
- Covers nearly all citizens age 65 and older
- Covers some disabled citizens under 65
- Financed by 2.9% payroll tax (+0.9% for high income earners)
- Average beneficiary receives $11,400 
- Adults over 65 generally have lower income than those under 65
- Transfer from relatively high incomes to lower incomes
- Reduces inequality (principle of transfers)
* Medicaid
- Provides insurance for low income families
- Covers 60 million people
- Reduces inequality 
* 
[[./img/kaestner_tab1.png]]
* Affordable Care Act
- Allows states to expand Medicaid coverage (many don't)
- Offers subsidies to people with less than 400% federal poverty level
- Increased the coverage for low-income workers
- Reduces inequality
*

* Employer provided healthcare
- Most middle and high-income earners receive insurance through their employer
- Employee contributions untaxed -- increases income of middle and top earners
- Increases inequality

* Question:
In terms of well-being (utility), is $5,000 per year in healthcare subsidies the same as an additional $5,000 in wages?

- "Levels and Trends in U.S. Income and its Distribution: A Crosswalk from Market Income towards a Comprehensive Haig-Simons Income Approach"
- How do different definitions of income change our measured inequality?
* Haig-Simons income
- Income is the amount of consumption plus the change in net worth
- Emphasizes consumption over market income
- A better representation of welfare
* Data
- Census Bureau's Current Population Survey, March supplement (March CPS)
- Survey data, asks respondents about *all* sources of income (minus capital gains)
- Health insurance status asked, and source of health insurance
- Health insurance premiums not captured, and are calculated by the Census Bureau
- Incomes are "top-coded", need to be estimated
- Capital gains, tax credits and liabilities predicted using a model
* The crosswalk
- Describe income in 4 ways:
  1. Market income (Piketty and Saez)
  2. Add transfer payments (disability, unemployment, social security, etc)
  3. Weight household size, add in kind transfers, add taxes
  4. Add realized capital gains

* Capital gains
- "Realized" capital gains are only observed when assets are sold
- Changes in wealth depend on the capital gains that are not "realized"
- If your portfolio goes up and you don't sell, your "income" has increased (at least in present value)
* 
[[./img/armour_tab3.png]]
* Why is the difference so dramatic?
- In 2007, compared to 1989, lower income people owned more:
  - Equity
  - Housing (!)
  - Businesses
* Housing since 2007
- Housing a primary source of capital "income"
- The 2007 recession resulted in a sharp decrease in housing
- This decrease was more severe among low-income home owners
- Housing shocks constrain ability to get credit, build wealth

* What can we conclude?
- Non-market sources of income matter
- Recent inequality caused by labor income, top 1%
- Capital gains matter
- Unresolved: How has capital ownership changed since the last recession?
