#+TITLE: Piketty's Capital
#+AUTHOR: ECON 499: Economics of Inequality
#+DATE: Winter 2018

* /Capital in the Twenty-First Century/
- Thomas Piketty (2013)
- 700 pages
- Past, present, and future of inequality
- #1 on the New York Times Best Seller list

* Income vs Wealth
Income is a /flow/ variable, measured in units per unit of time
- Dollars per hour, thousands of dollars per year, etc
Wealth is a /stock/ variable, measured as a total amount
- Amount of money in your bank account
- Value of assets you own

* Capital income
- Wealth is a source of income
- S=I
- Capital income increases as wealth increases

* 3 facts
1. Labor income inequality is higher in the US than in Europe, opposite of 1900
2. Wealth inequality more concentrated than income inequality
3. Wealth to income ratios are U-shaped in Europe, flat in US

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The United States is the land of booming top labor incomes; Europe is the land of booming wealth (albeit with a lower wealth concentration than in the United States). These are distinct phenomena, involving different economic mechanisms and different parts of the developed world.

* Piketty's "first fundamental law of capitalism"
$$\text{Capital share of income}=\alpha =r\dfrac{K}{Y}$$
- Just a definition
- $r$ is the return on capital 
- $rK$ is capital income per year
- $rK/Y$ is share of capital income to total income (Y)

* Piketty's "second fundamental law of capitalism"
$$\dfrac{\bar{K}}{\bar{Y}} = \dfrac{s}{g}$$
- $s$ is the /net/ savings rate 
- $g$ long-run growth rate
- $Y$ is /net/ income

* Example
$s=0.10$
- $g=0.03$:
$$\dfrac{\bar{K}}{\bar{Y}} = \dfrac{0.1}{0.03} = 3.33$$
- $g=0.015$:
$$\dfrac{\bar{K}}{\bar{Y}} = \dfrac{0.1}{0.015} = 6.66$$

* US wealth/income ratio
Why is US not seeing accumulating wealth?
- Population growing faster in US (causes growth)
- Savings rate lower in US

* $r-g$
- Suppose two people in society: one with capital income, one with labor income
- Labor income grows at rate $g$
- Capital income grows at rate $r$
- If $r>g$, capital income accumulates faster than labor income
- Capital begets capital (part of capital income is saved), so wealth inequality increases

* Putting it all together
- Lower growth rates cause $K/Y$ to increase
- Capital share increases ($rK/Y$)
- $r>g$: capital incomes diverge from labor incomes
- Wealth more concentrated than labor income

* Labor and capital
- Most of current inequality is caused by labor, not capital
- High wage-earners are able to save more of their incomes, accumulate capital
- We might expect top wage earners to transition to capital earners

* First law
$$\alpha =r\dfrac{K}{Y}$$
If $K/Y$ increasing to steady state, will $\alpha$ increase?
- If $r$ goes down, then capital share of income may not decrease
- If $r$ stays the same or goes up, then capital share will increase

* What determines $r$?
- $r$ is the return on capital
- With competitive markets, equal to the marginal productivity of capital (MPK)
- MPK is a function of level of capital (-) and technology (+)
- "Capital augmenting" technology can keep $r$ high in the long run
- Solow, 2014:

There is no logical necessity for the rate of return to exceed the growth rate...but there is no invisible hand to steer a market economy away from this perversity. 
#+END_QUOTE

* Capitalism and inequality
- Piketty shows that there is no "law" of capitalism that ensures inequality will fall
- Capital income can be derived from skilled investing, but unskilled investing can earn high income if wealth is high
- Increasing wealth might imply increasing inherited wealth

* Patrimonial capital
- Wealth is inherited from parents
- You can earn capital income simply because your parents earn capital income (no skills required!)
- This was the case for most of history, until 20th century
- Piketty argues that the 20th century is an anomoly, driven by negative capital shocks (world wars) and high growth (convergence)
- $r>g$ implies a return to patrimonial capitalism, widening gulf between capital and labor
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The reason why wealth today is not as unequally distributed as in the past is simply that not enough time has passed since 1945.
