#+TITLE: Critiques of Piketty's Capital

* Piketty's "first fundamental law of capitalism"
$$\text{Capital share of income}=\alpha =r\dfrac{K}{Y}$$
- Just a definition
- $r$ is the return on capital 
- $rK$ is capital income per year
- $rK/Y$ is share of capital income to total income (Y)

* Why is $\alpha$ changing?
- Changes in r, s, g not enough to explain changes in $\alpha$
- Evidence suggests that increase in $\alpha$ mostly attributed to rising home prices
- Housing more evenly distributed than other forms of wealth

* Piketty's "second fundamental law of capitalism"
$$\dfrac{\bar{K}}{\bar{Y}} = \dfrac{s}{g}$$
- $s$ is the /net/ savings rate 
- $g$ long-run growth rate
- $Y$ is /net/ income

* Savings rates
- Basic Solow: constant /gross/ savings rate
- Piketty's Solow: constant /net/ savings rate
- If $g$ falls, $K/Y$ rises if $s$ remains unchanged
- How will $K/Y$ change as $g$ falls in both models?

* Which model is better?
- The savings rate is a decision variable
- Models with /endogenous/ savings seem to suggest that "basic" Solow is closer to "microfounded" agent behavior
- With competitive markets, net savings is theoretically 0!
- What do the data say?

* $r-g~$ in theory
- $r>g$ does not necessarily imply more inequality
- Small amounts of social mobility mean $r>g$ can lead to a *decrease* in inequality
- High returns on capital encourage people to save more, accumulate wealth (endogenous $s$)

* $r-g~$ in history
- Piketty does not show any correlations between $r-g$ and inequality
- From 1870 to 2012:
  - Increases in $r-g$ are not associated with rising top income share
  - Same holds for many definitions of $r$
  - No long term effects in the data either

* Capital mobility and capital returns
- Capital is generally very mobile across national boundaries
- The rich can earn a high return even if there are low returns in their home country
- Returns should equalize across countries
- Wealth accumulation should occur everywhere

* South Africa and Sweden
- Both countries capitalist
  - "Fundamental laws of capitalism" should apply equally in both places
- Inequality in SA much different than inequality in Sweden
- SA inequality was/is institutionalized (apartheid)
- Changes in inequality reflect changes in institutions more than $r-g$
