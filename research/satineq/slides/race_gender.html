<h2 id="orgcb4ab6e">Limits of economic methodology</h2>
<ul>
<li>Economics poorly equipped to answer moral questions</li>
<li>Preferences are almost always assumed to be <i>exogenous</i></li>
<li>Social pressures can affect preferences (racism, sexism)</li>
<li>Economic notions of "efficiency" and "optimality" cannot account for these influences</li>

<ul>
<li>Markets with no barriers to entry</li>
<li>Positive profits induce other firms to enter the industry, causes profits to fall</li>
<li>Long-run (economic) profits are equal to zero</li>

<ul>
<li>Suppose two types of workers with identical productivities, different observable characteristics (race, gender, etc)</li>
<li>Profit maximizing firms will choose the lower cost worker (more profits)</li>
<li>Demand for lower-cost workers increases, wages increase</li>
<li>Long run: no wage gap between workers</li>

<ul>
<li>Two types of workers, A and B (same productivity)</li>
<li>Managers dislike type A workers (prejudice)</li>
<li>Firms willing to pay premium for type B workers ($x in foregone profits)</li>

<ul>
<li>Firms differ in amount of profits willing to sacrifice to hire type B</li>
<li>Firms with lower prejudice will hire only type A, have higher profits</li>
<li>Lower prejudice firms will out-compete higher prejudice firms, eliminating wage gap (but firms are segregated)</li>

<ul>
<li>Simple model assumes workers and firms have perfect information, can match without cost</li>
<li>In reality, firms may not perfectly observe productivity, search costs are borne by workers and firms</li>
<li>If prejudice exists:
<ol>
<li>Type A workers will not apply to jobs that type B workers apply to</li>
<li>Type A workers will accept lower wages (harder to find work)</li>
<li>Self-reinforcing: Willingness to take less suitable jobs will induce firms to offer lower wages to type A workers</li>

<h2 id="org559eec5">Doleac and Hansen (2017)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Many employers ask if applicants have been convicted of a crime</li>
<li>Some jurisdictions have made such questions illegal, unfairly discriminates against minorities and former criminals (black men more likely to have convictions than white men)</li>

</ul>
<blockquote nil>
<p>
We find that ban-the-box policies decrease the probability of being employed by 3.4 percentage points (5.1%) for young, low-skilled black men, and by 2.3 percentage points (2.9%) for young, low-skilled Hispanic men. These findings support the hypothesis that when an applicantâ€™s criminal history is unavailable, employers statistically discriminate against demographic groups that include more ex-offenders.

<ul>
<li>Suppose A and B have same productivities, and both can be observed after they are hired</li>
<li>Workers can invest in skills, obtain "signals" (degrees, certifications, etc)</li>
<li>Firms have different expectations about A and B workers: for a given signal, firms think type A less likely to have associated skills (affirmative action?)</li>
<li>Signals are less valuable to type A workers, less willing to invest in obtaining them</li>
<li>Different outcomes determined only by expectations, not information or intrinsic differences</li>

<h2 id="org73ba31a">Self-reinforcing inequality</h2>
<ul>
<li>Competitive market forces tend to decrease inequality based on race/gender</li>
<li>Other models show that initial inequality can persist, be self-reinforcing (like Piketty)</li>
<li>Persistent inequality may be a <i>consequence</i> of initial inequality</li>

<ul>
<li>Is there discrimination in labor markets?</li>
<li>How do we distinguish statistical discrimination from other, more nefarious forms?</li>
<li>Researches cannot randomly assign race or gender, strongly correlated with environment and experience which affect labor market outcomes</li>
<li>Usual approach is to compare people of different races that are similar along other, observable dimensions</li>
<li>In practice, impossible to control for cultural and institutional differences experienced by different races</li>

<li>"White names" received call-backs 10.1% of the time</li>
