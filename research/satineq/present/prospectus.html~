	  ### Introduction

	  - Burgeoning field of "envirodevonomics" (Greenstone and Jack, 2015) seeks to uncover the relationships between the environment and economic development
	  
	  - Much of the developing world is plagued by information and data shortages, particularly with respect to environmental quality

	  - Much recent emphasis on using remotely-sensed data from satellites and other sources to overcome these data limitations (Donaldson and Storeygard, 2016)

	  - Established methodologies and results from other fields (geography, machine learning) can be applied economic questions
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### My contributions

	  - I develop new methodologies to estimate development outcomes and environmental quality at a national level, using India as an example

	  - These methodologies require little "on the ground" data, can be applied to nearly any country in a variety of settings

	  ## Estimating Regional Inequality and Growth Using Satellite Data

	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Motivation

	  - Little is known about the distribution of economic resources in the developing world

	  - Satellite imagery has been used to separately analyze population density and economic activity

	  - Combining these approaches allows for the identification of per capita economic activity at a small (1km) resolution

	  - What is the relationship between inequality and regional growth?
	  
	  - What is the relationship between inequality and policy?
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Overview

	  - Using a machine learning algorithm, I create a panel of per capita economic activity at a 1km resolution for the years 1996-2010

	  - Negative relationship between inequality and aggregate income

	  - Positive relationship between inequality and growth in the cross-section

	  - Preliminary panel results with fixed-effects indicate a negative relationship between inequality and growth

	  - I propose a methodology to investigate potential political causes of inequality and poverty
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Previous literature

	  Inequality in the developing world:

	  - World Wealth and Income Database (wid.world), Alvaredo et al, (2017)

	  > "[W]e stress the need for
more democratic transparency on income and wealth dynamics and better access to administrative
	  and financial data."

	  Population estimation:

	  - ORNL's LandScan; WorldPop

	  - Proprietary, limited years, not appropriate for time series analysis

	  Night lights and economic activity:

	  - Henderson, Storeygard, Weil (2012)
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Data

	  Ground-based sources:

	  - Census of India, 2001 and 2011: District level population counts

	  Extraterrestrial sources:
	  
	  - Landsat 5, 7, & 8: Six spectral bands, 30x30m resolution, 16-day period, 1984-present

	  - Defense Meteorological Satellite Program: Night light intensity, 1x1km resolution, annual observations, 1992-present

	  - Shuttle Radar Topography Mission: Global elevation, 30x30m resolution (2000)
	  
	</section>

	<section>
	  
	  <section data-markdown>
	    ### Population estimation

	    For each census year:
	    
	    - Create a raster data set with nine layers: six Landsat bands, elevation, night lights, distance to closest permanent body of water (Pekel et al, 2016)

	    - Estimation data: Calculate mean, variance, and correlation between each band at the district level

	    - Prediction data: Calculate same summary statistics within a 5km gaussian kernel around each 30x30m pixel, resample to 1x1km resolution

	    ### Composite images

	    - For each census year, compile every satellite image taken that year

	    - Mask cloudy pixels

	    - Calculate "greenest-pixel" composite: For each pixel, choose the image with the highest NDVI index

	    - Calculate summary statistics at district and pixel level for composite images
	  </section>
	  
	</section>

	<section>
	  <section data-markdown>
	    ### Night light data

	    - Night lights are log-linearly predictive of GDP (Henderson, Storeygard, Weil, 2012)
	    
	    - Raw DMSP data are top-coded

	    - Hsu et al (2015) account for top-coding by combining observations from multiple sensors

	    - Calibrated data for 1996, 1999, 2000, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2010

	    - Inter-annual calibration achieved by regressing country-level aggregates against GDP for each year

	  ### Estimating population density 

	  - Let *S* be the collection of summary staistics
	  
	  - The (log) population density in district *d* in time *t* is described by:

	  ###### $y\_{dt} = f(S\_{dt}) + \epsilon\_{dt}$

	  - The relationship between satellite observations and density is highly non-linear, high-level interaction between satellite bands

	  - I estimate *f* with a *random forest* algorithm (Breiman, 2001)
	  
	</section>

	<section>
	  <section data-markdown>
	    ### Random forests

	    - A random forest is a collection of regression trees

	    - Each regression tree partitions the data based on the observation that minimizes left-hand-side sum of squares

	    - Each regression tree is grown on a bootstrapped sample, with each partition selected from among a random subset of covariates

	    - Random forests are nonlinear, high levels of predictive accuracy
	    
	    - Randomization prevents overfitting

	    - Find the partition value that minimizes the sum of the MSEs
	    - Repeat for each covariate

	  ### Variable importance

	  - The primary drawback of the random forest model is the inability to extract marginal effects

	  - Can instead calculate "node purity," which measures the average amount variance reduction that is realized when a covariate is used in partitioning

	  - Can be misleading: Variables might only have high predictive power when interacted with other variables

	  ### Per capita economic activity

	  - The random forest predicts population at a 1x1km resolution

	  - The GDP-calibrated lights are at the same resolution

	  - Average per capita economic activity is estimated by dividing lights by population for each pixel

	    ### Estimating inequality

	    - Pixel-level estimates can be used to calculate between-pixel inequality and per capita growth for any arbitrary geographic area

	    - Measure inequality using the Theil index (subgroup additive, scale invariant)

	    - Allows for the relationship between per capita growth and inequality to be explored at a sub-national level

	    ##### (More)
	  </section>


	  <section data-markdown>
	    ### Spatial resolution
	    - Lights per capita are estimated at a 1x1km spatial resolution
	    - Partition $Y$ into $G$ groups representing different pixels

	    $$ Y = Y^1, Y^2,..., Y^G $$
	  </section>

	  <section data-markdown>
	    ### Subgroup additivity
	    - An index $I(Y)$ is *subgroup additive* if:

	    $$ I(Y) = \sum_{g=1}^G \alpha_g I(Y^g) + I(N_1\bar{y}^1, N_2\bar{y}^2,...,N_G\bar{y}^G) $$
	  </section>

	  <section data-markdown>
	    ### Between-group inequality
	    - If $I(Y)$ is subgroup additive, then the between-group inequality measure is invariant to within-group inequality
	    - The between-group index measures the contribution of spatial inequality to aggregate inequality
	  </section>

	  <section>
	    <h3>Theil index</h3>
	    $$ T(Y) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N\frac{y_i}{\bar{y}}\ln\frac{y_i}{\bar{y}} $$

	    <p> $T(Y)$ is subgroup additive: </p>

	    $$ T(Y) = \sum_{g=1}^G \frac{N^g\bar{y}^g}{N\bar{y}} T(Y^g) + \sum_{g=1}^G\frac{N^g\bar{y}^g}{N\bar{y}}\ln \frac{\bar{y}^g}{\bar{y}} $$

	  ### Inequality and growth

	  Initial inequality is positively correlated with subsequent growth

	  - Convergence: Low-income regions may grow faster than high-income regions within districts

	  - Omitted variables: District-specific characteristics may cause both initial inequality and subsequent growth rates
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Preliminary answers

	  - The fitted random forest algorithm can predict population in any year that the satellite data are available

	  - Population is predicted for each year in the Hsu et al calibrated night-light data

	  - Calculate annual average growth rates for each districts between the observations

	  ###### $\log\left(\dfrac{lights\_{dt}}{lights\_{dt-1}}\right) = \beta\_1 \log\left(lights\_{dt-1}\right) + \beta\_2Theil_{dt-1} + \delta\_d + \tau\_t + \epsilon\_{dt}$

	  ## Measuring the Effects of Pollution Abatement in the Presence of Treatment Externalities

	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Background

	  - India's rivers are heavily utilized and dangerously polluted

	  - 14,780 sewage treatment plants (STPs) in the United States, 234 in India

	  - Nearly 1 trillion USD has been spent by the government of India to combat pollution levels, widely believed to be ineffective

	  - No systematic study of the effectiveness of any specific policy intervention at the national level
	</section>
	
	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Overview

	  - Estimate the effects of a specific policy intervention (the construction of new STPs in 1995)

	  - Develop a novel econometric model to account for downstream pollution and treatment spillovers

	  - Failing to account for downstream effects can significantly bias estimated treatment effects

	  - Propose a methodology to analyze the political economy of STP placement and operational effectiveness 
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Previous literature

	  - Greenstone and Hanna (2014): Find no pollution reduction on Indian river segments designated as "problem areas" by the government using a simple difference-in-differences approach

	  - Lipscomb and Mobarak (2015): Estimate downstream spillovers in Brazil using exogenous shifts in administrative boundaries
	  
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Data

	  River monitoring stations:

	  - 447 stations across India

	  - Located along 60 river systems

	  - Monthly observations of fecal coliform bacteria (fcoli) from 1986 to 2004 (many missing observations)

	  Sewage treatment plants (STPs)

	  - Ministry of Environment and Forests periodically attempts to collect information on the known universe of STPs

	  - 107 were build in 1995 as part of the National River Conservation Plan (NRCP)

	  ### Treatment externalities

	  - 447 monitoring stations along 60 river systems
	  
	  - Each river system has 7.45 monitoring stations on average

	  - 28 river systems have one monitoring station

	  - The Ganga system has 109 stations

	  - A single STP is likely to decrease measured pollution at multiple stations, biasing the diff-in-diff

	  ### Downstream effects

	  - Pollution levels measured at each monitoring station are a function of upstream pollution levels

	  - Shocks and treatment persist downstream, contaminating observations at each downstream station

	  - Biases treatment effect estimates and standard errors

	  - I account for this with a spatial model, where pollution observations are allowed to be functions of upstream pollution observations

	    <li>  Each entry of the matrix $W(\rho)^k$ gives the exponential of distance between an STP and the monitoring station k stations downstream </li>
	    <li> The infinite sum therefore captures the total downstream effects of an STP on all downstream stations </li>
	    <li> This result obtains from the novel exponential specification of the spatial weights matrix </li>
	    <li> The error term is similarly a function of upstream errors </li>
	  </ul>
	  
	</section>

	<section>
	  <section data-markdown>
	    ### Estimating the spatial model

	    - There are 1,124 parameters to be estimated

	    - MLE computationally inefficient, unlikely to converge, with unreliable Hessian estimates

	    - Estimated instead as a Bayesian model with uniform priors (No-U-Turn sampler)

	    ##### (More)
	  </section>

	  <section data-markdown>
	    ### Priors

	    - $\rho$, $\lambda$: Exponential(1). Likelihood function is approximately uniform for large values.

	    - Fixed effects: Uniform

	    - Treatment effects: Uniform

	  ### Health benefits

	  - Increasing fcoli by 2.3 doubles the likelihood of contracting a gastrointestinal illness

	  - Estimated treatment effect will reduce this likelihood by 15% immediately downstream of a STP

	  - Maha Kumbh festival attracts 120 million attendees, most of whom bath in the Ganga

	  - An operational STP immediately upstream of the festival would eliminate approximately 600,000 cases of gastrointestinal disease
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Accounting for the decrease in effectiveness

	  - Government officials inspected 84 of 236 known STPs in 2007

	  - 55% were rated as being in "poor" or "very poor" working condition

	  ### Ongoing research

	  - Use remotely-sensed luminosity, population, and watershed data to predict pollution levels along all river stretches with the spatial model described above

	  - Estimate optimal placement of STPs, compare to actual placement

	  - Investigate the political economy of STP placement and ongoing operation (elections of 1996)

	  ## Air Pollution and the Placement of Pollution Monitors

	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Motivation

	  - India's air-pollution monitoring network only extends to 14 metropolitan areas

	  - Monitoring is frequently interrupted at individual locations for unknown reasons

	  - Zou (2017) shows that US firms change emissions behavior based on scheduled downtime of EPA monitors

	  - Grainger et al (2016) show endogenous placement of pollution monitors near non-attainment limits in US
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Data

	  - The Ministry of Environment and Forests logs the days in which each air pollution monitor is active

	  - Van Donkelaar et al (2016) estimate annual PM$\_{2.5}$ measurements at a 1x1km resolution worldwide

	  - Daily observations of aerosol depth from the MODIS satellites are available at a 3x3km resolution, highly correlated with PM$\_{2.5}$

	  <img src='img/eqsimul.png' width=55%>

	  <ul>
	    <li> $M_{dt}$: Dummy equal to 1 if monitor is operational in district $d$ at time $t$ </li>
	    <li> $f(\beta, PM_{dt})$: A non-linear (polynomial) function of PM levels </li>
	    <li>$X_{dt}, ~Y_{dt}$: District-level controls</li>
	    <li> Identification assumption: Lagged pollution monitoring affects current PM levels but not current monitoring probabilities </li>
