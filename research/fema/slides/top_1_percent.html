<ul>
<li>Piketty and Saez speculate that tax rates and "social attitudes" are responsible</li>
<li>Do not provide conclusive evidence</li>
<li>Other explanations: Political "capture," exploitation, fraud, skills, etc</li>

<h2 id="org6c479b2">Economic rents</h2>
<ul>
<li>Things that are used in production of goods and services are called <i>factors of production</i> (labor, machines, factories, etc)</li>
<li>Factors are compensated because they are productive (wages, interest, etc)</li>
<li>A payment received by a factor beyond what can be explained by their productivity is a <b>rent</b>
<ul>
<li>Examples: Occupational licensing, monopolies, patents</li>

</ul></li>
<li>A rent is wealth that is earned through a process that does not itself create wealth</li>
<li>Are top wage earners very productive, or do they receive rents?</li>

<li>They might be able to use this power to pay themselves more than what they are otherwise worth (extract rents)</li>
<li>If so, we expect CEO pay to diverge from other top earners</li>

<blockquote nil>
<p>
&#x2026;the breadth of the occupations that have seen a rise in top income levels is much more consistent with the argument that the increase in "superstar" pay (or pay at the top) has been driven by the growth of information and communications technology, and the ways this technology allows individuals with particular skills that are in high demand to expand the scale of their performance
