#+TITLE: Critiques of Piketty's Capital
#+AUTHOR: ECON 499: Economics of Inequality
#+DATE: Winter 2018

* Piketty's "first fundamental law of capitalism"
$$\text{Capital share of income}=\alpha =r\dfrac{K}{Y}$$
- Just a definition
- $r$ is the return on capital 
- $rK$ is capital income per year
- $rK/Y$ is share of capital income to total income (Y)

*

* Why is $\alpha$ changing?
- Changes in r, s, g not enough to explain changes in $\alpha$
- Evidence suggests that increase in $\alpha$ mostly attributed to rising home prices
- Housing more evenly distributed than other forms of wealth

* Piketty's "second fundamental law of capitalism"
$$\dfrac{\bar{K}}{\bar{Y}} = \dfrac{s}{g}$$
- $s$ is the /net/ savings rate 
- $g$ long-run growth rate
- $Y$ is /net/ income

* Savings rates
- Basic Solow: constant /gross/ savings rate
- Piketty's Solow: constant /net/ savings rate
- If $g$ falls, $\frac{K}{Y}$ rises if $s$ remains unchanged
- How will $k/y$ change as $g$ falls in both models?

* Which model is better?
- The savings rate is a decision variable
- Models with /endogenous/ savings seem to suggest that "basic" Solow is closer to "microfounded" agent behavior
- With competitive markets, net savings is theoretically 0!
- What do the data say?

	  ### $r-g$ in theory

	  - $r>g$ does not necessarily imply more inequality

	  - Small amounts of social mobility mean $r>g$ can lead to a *decrease* in inequality

	  - High returns on capital encourage people to save more, accumulate wealth
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### $r-g$ in history

	  - Piketty does not show any correlations between $r-g$ and inequality
	  
	  From 1870 to 2012:

	  - Increases in $r-g$ are not associated with rising top income share

	  - Same holds for many definitions of $r$

	  - No long term effects in the data either
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Capital mobility and capital returns

	  - Capital is generally very mobile across national boundaries

	  - The rich can earn a high return even if there are low returns in their home country

	  - Returns should equalize across countries

	  - Wealth accumulation should occur everywhere

	  ### South Africa and Sweden

	  - Both countries capitalist
	  
	  - Inequality in SA much different than inequality in Sweden

	  - SA inequality was/is institutionalized (apartheid)

	  - Changes in inequality reflect changes in institutions more than $r-g$

	  ### Is inequality good for the economy?

	  ### LeBron James parable

	  - Steve Jobs improved the economic well being of many people

	  - Was compensated very well for his efforts

	  - Is it bad that he accumulated wealth?
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Equality of opportunity

	  - Inequality is bad if it means unequal access to opportunity

	  - Great Gatsby curve, Moving to Opportunity, etc

	  - Genetics likely play a large part
	  
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Genetics and economic outcomes

	  - Studies on twins (same genes) raised in separate households suggest genes factor heavily into economic outcomes

	  - Low intergenerational mobility is largely due to genes, rather than environment

	  - Unequal opportunity more relevant at lower incomes, not higher incomes
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ### Equity-efficiency tradeoff

	  - Governments cannot observe genetic productivity

	  - Some high-productivity people might want to work very little

	  - Society loses if productive people work less

	  - Since government cannot distinguish lazy from low productivity, redistribution may encourage some productive workers to work less

	  - Some inequality is therefore preferred

	  ### Solow's response to Mankiw (on Canvas)

	  > The cheerful blandness of Gregory Mankiwâ€™s "Defending the One Percent" may divert attention from its occasional unstated premises, dubious assumptions, and omitted facts. I have room to point only to a few such weaknesses; but the One Percent are pretty good at defending themselves, so that any assistance they get from the sidelines deserves scrutiny.
