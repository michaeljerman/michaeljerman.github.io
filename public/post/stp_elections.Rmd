## Abstract

We study the effect of the 1996 Lok Sabha election on investment in pollution abatement and pollution monitoring. The election of 1996 was contemporaneous with the Ganga Action Plan (Phase II), a major federal program designed to reduce the dangerous pollution levels of the Ganges and its major tributaries. The election signaled the end of one-party rule of the government and ushered in a new era of electoral competitiveness. We find that cities in electoral districts where one of the main opposition parties was competitive in the 1996 election were more likely to receive pollution abatement investment from the federal government as part of the Ganga Action Plan. Conversely, we find some evidence that cities where the historically dominant political party was competitive were less likely to receive abatement investment, though this latter result is less robust. We also find that cities where the opposition parties were competitive were less likely to be covered by the river pollution monitoring network in the years following the election. The results indicate that policymakers consider electoral outcomes when allocating scarce resources for abatement and monitoring.
